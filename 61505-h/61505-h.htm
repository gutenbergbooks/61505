<p>The name of Sappho will never die.
But it lives in most of the minds that
know it at all to-day as hardly more
than the hazy nucleus of a ragged fringe suggestive
of erotic thoughts or of sexual perversion.
Very seldom does it evoke the vision of
a great and pure poetess with marvellous
expressions of beauty, grace, and power at her
command, who not only haunts the dawn of
Grecian Lyric poetry but lives in scattered and
broken lights that glint from vases and papyri
and from the pages of cold grammarians and
warm admirers, whose eulogies we would gladly
trade for the unrecorded poems which they
quote so meagerly. Sappho has furnished the
title of such a novel as Daudet’s <cite>Sapho</cite>. It
figures in suggestive moving pictures.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Note_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
name will answer prettily as that of a bird or
even a boat such as the yacht with which Mr.
Douglas defended the American cup in 1871.
The modern idea of Sappho truly seems to be
based mainly on Daudet, who with Pierre
Louys in recent times has done most to degrade
her good character and who goes so far
as to say that “the word Sappho itself by the
force of rolling descent through ages is encrusted
with unclean legends and has degenerated
from the name of a goddess to that of a
malady.” But to the lover of lyrics, who is
also a student of Greek Literature in Greek,
this poetess of passion becomes a living and
illustrious personality, who of all the poets of
the world, as Symonds says, is the “one whose
every word has a peculiar and unmistakable
perfume, a seal of absolute perfection and
inimitable grace.” “Sappho,” says Tennyson in
<cite>The Princess</cite>, “in arts of grace vied with any
man.” She is one whose fervid fragments, as the
great Irish translator of the <cite>Odes</cite> of Anacreon
and the <cite>Anacreontics</cite>, Thomas Moore, says in
his <cite>Evenings in Greece</cite>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Still, like sparkles of Greek Fire,</div>
<div class="verse">Undying, even beneath the wave,</div>
<div class="verse">Burn on thro’ time and ne’er expire,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">a prophecy still true even in this materialistic
day. Sappho, herself, had intimations
of immortality, for she writes with perfect
beauty and modesty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Μνάσεσθαί τινά φαμι καὶ ὔστερον ἀμμέων</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I say some one will think of us hereafter.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This brief, pellucid verse Swinburne in his
<cite>Anactoria</cite> has distorted into the gorgeous emotional
rhetoric of fourteen verses. But its own
quiet prophecy stands good to-day. A fragment
first published in 1922<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Note_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> also seems to
make her say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">and yet great</div>
<div class="verse">glory will come to thee in all places</div>
<div class="verse">where Phaëthon [shines]</div>
<div class="verse">and even in Acheron’s halls</div>
<div class="verse">[thou shalt be honored.]</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In general, antiquity thought of her as “<em>the</em>
poetess” κατ’ἐξοχήν, ἡ ποιήτρια,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Note_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> just as Professor
Harmon has recently shown<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Note_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> that “the poet”
in ancient literature means Homer. Down to
the present day Sappho has kept the definite
article which antiquity gave her and has been
called <em>the</em> poetess, though we must be careful to
test a writer’s use of the term. Therefore, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
must not understand by the absence of any
added epithet, as Wharton does, that Tennyson
rates her higher than all other poets, merely
because in <cite>Locksley Hall, Sixty Years After</cite> he
speaks of Sappho as “The Poet,” having called
her in his youth “The Ancient Poetess,”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Note_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>—for
he also speaks of Dante as “The Poet,”
when in <cite>Locksley Hall</cite> he says, “this is truth
the poet sings,” and then cites verse 121 of the
<cite>Inferno</cite>. It is rare, however, even in modern
times to find Sappho classed with any other
poet as a peer, as in the beautiful tribute <cite>To
Christina Rossetti</cite> of William Watson, one of
the best modern writers of epigrams, where
Mrs. Browning and Sappho are the two other
women referred to:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Songstress, in all times ended and begun,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Thy billowy-bosom’d fellows are not three.</div>
<div class="verse">Of those sweet peers, the grass is green o’er one;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And blue above the other is the sea.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In ancient days Pinytus (1st cent. <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) composed
this epigram:<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Note_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Tullius Laureas, who wrote both in Greek and
Latin about 60 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, puts into her mouth the
following: “When you pass my Aeolian grave,
stranger, call not the songstress of Mytilene
dead. For ’tis true this tomb was built by the
hands of men, and such works of humankind
sink swiftly into oblivion; yet if you ask after
me for the sake of the holy Muses from each
of whom I have taken a flower for my posy of
nine, you shall know that I have escaped the
darkness of Death, and no sun shall ever rise
that keepeth not the name of the lyrist Sappho.”
(Edmonds, with variations.)</p>

<p>Posidippus<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Note_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> (250 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) says:</p>

<p class="noindent">That inadequate and misleading metaphor of
fire, as Mackail says, recurs in all her eulogists.
Μεμιγμένα πυρὶ φθέγγεται, “her words are
mingled with fire,” writes Plutarch,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Note_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> but the
“fire” of the burning Sappho is not raging hot,
it is an unscorching calm, brilliant lustre that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
makes other poetry seem cold by comparison.
No wonder that Hermesianax<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Note_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> (about 290 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>)
called her “that nightingale of hymns” and
Lucian<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Note_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> “the honeyed boast of the Lesbians.”
Strabo (1 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) said: “Sappho is a marvellous
creature (θαυμαστόν τι χρῆμα), in all history you
will find no woman who can challenge comparison
with her even in the slightest degree.”
Antipater of Thessalonica (10 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) named
Sappho as one of the nine poetesses who were
god-tongued and called her one of the nine
muses: “The female Homer: Sappho pride
and choice of Lesbian dames, whose locks have
earned a name.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Note_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> In another epigram in the
<cite>Anthology</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Note_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> probably from the base of a lost
statue of Sappho in the famous library at Pergamum,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Note_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
and which Jucundus and Cyriac were
able to cite many hundreds of years later,
Antipater says,</p>

timidly defends the genuineness. Antipater of
Sidon (150 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>)<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Note_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> in his encomium on Sappho
tells how</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Amazement seized Mnemosyne</div>
<div class="verse">At Sappho’s honey’d song:</div>
<div class="verse">‘What, does a tenth muse,’ then, cried she,</div>
<div class="verse">‘To mortal men belong!’</div>
<div class="attr">(<span class="smcap">Wellesley</span>)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He also speaks<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Note_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> of Sappho as “one that is
sung for a mortal Muse among Muses immortal
... a delight unto Greece.” Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Note_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
(180 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) says: “Sappho, thou Muse of Aeolian
Eresus, sweetest of all love-pillows unto the
burning young, sure am I that Pieria or ivied
Helicon must honour thee, along with the
Muses, seeing that thy spirit is their spirit.”
Again, in an anonymous epigram<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Note_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> it is said:
“her song will seem Calliope’s own voice.”
Another writer,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Note_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> also anonymous, discussing
the nine lyric poets, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Catullus<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Note_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> speaks of the <i lang="la">Sapphica Musa</i>, and

Pieriis Sappho soror addita Musis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Note_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>If we turn now from the praise of the ancients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to modern literary critics of classic lore
we shall not find any depredation but rather
an enhancing of that ancient praise. The classic
estimate of Sappho holds its own and more
than holds it to-day. J. A. K. Thomson in his
<cite>Greeks and Barbarians</cite><a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Note_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> says: “Landor is not
Greek any more than Leconte de Lisle is Greek ...
they have not the banked and inward-burning
fire which makes Sappho so different.”
Mackail speaks of “the feeling expressed in
splendid but hardly exaggerated language by
Swinburne, in that early poem where, alone
among the moderns, he has mastered and all
but reproduced one of her favourite metres, the
Sapphic stanza which she invented and to which
she gave her name”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Ah the singing, ah the delight, the passion!</div>
<div class="verse">All the Loves wept, listening; sick with anguish,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Swinburne himself was thoroughly steeped
in Sappho whom he considered “the supreme
success, the final achievement of the poetic art.”
He laid abounding tribute at her feet both in
verse and prose. In an appreciation first published
posthumously in 1914 in <cite>The Living Age</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Note_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
he says: “Judging even from the mutilated
fragments fallen within our reach from the
broken altar of her sacrifice of song, I for one
have always agreed with all Grecian tradition
in thinking Sappho to be beyond all question
and comparison <em>the very greatest poet that ever
lived</em>. Aeschylus is the greatest poet who ever
was also a prophet; Shakespeare is the greatest
dramatist who ever was also a poet, but Sappho
is simply nothing less—as she is certainly
nothing more—than the greatest poet who
ever was at all. Such at least is the simple and
sincere profession of my lifelong faith.” Alfred
Noyes recognizes in Swinburne’s praise of
Sappho a spirit which would make them congenial
companions in another world, when in
the poem <cite>In Memory of Swinburne</cite> he writes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thee, the storm-bird, nightingale-souled,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Brother of Sappho, the seas reclaim!</div>

<div class="verse indent1">Mad with her music, exultant, aflame;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Thee, thee too, shall their glory enfold,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Lit with thy snow-winged fame.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Back, thro’ the years, fleets the sea-bird’s wing:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Sappho, of old time, once,—ah, hark!</div>
<div class="verse">So did he love her of old and sing!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Listen, he flies to her, back thro’ the dark!</div>

<div class="verse">Out to the sea of Eternity, singing</div>
<div class="verse indent1">‘Mother, thy child comes home.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>J. W. Mackail echoes Swinburne’s high
praise: “Many women have written poetry
and some have written poetry of high merit
and extreme beauty. But no other woman can
claim an assured place in the first rank of
poets” ... “The sole woman of any age or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
country who gained and still holds an unchallenged
place in the first rank of the world’s
poets, she is also one of the few poets of whom
it may be said with confidence that they hold
of none and borrow of none, and that their
poetry is, in some unique way, an immediate
inspiration.”</p>

<p>Many another modern critic ranks Sappho as
supreme. Typical are such eulogies as “Sappho,
the most famous of all women” (Aldington), or
“Sappho, incomparably the greatest poetess the
world has ever seen” (Watts-Dunton in ninth
ed. <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>).</p>

<p>It is my purpose in the limited space at my
disposal to show in a general way, since it
will not be possible to go into details, the
truth of Sappho’s prophecy that men would
think of her<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Note_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> in after-times: to show her importance
as a woman and poetess and our debt
to her, and also to give my readers some acquaintance
with the real and the unreal Sappho
so that they can judge how much is fact and
how much is fancy in what they hear and read
about Sappho, thus proving again that the warp
and woof of literature cannot be understood without
a knowledge of the original Greek threads.
This chapter will consider Sappho’s Life.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we know little of Sappho herself,
and about that little there is doubt. Even
the ancient lives of Sappho are lost. If we had
Chamaeleon’s work on Sappho,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Note_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> or the exegesis
of Sappho and Alcaeus<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Note_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> by Callias of Mytilene,
or the book on Sappho’s metres by Dracon of
Stratonicea, we should not be left so in the dark;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
but all these have perished or, what comes to
the same thing, are undiscovered. Like Homer,
Sappho gives us almost no definite information
about herself, and we must depend on late lexicographers,
commentators, and imitators. Villainous
stories arose about her and gathered added
vileness till they reached a climax in the licentious
Latin of Ovid, especially as seen in Pope’s translation
of the epistle of Sappho to Phaon.</p>

<p>Sappho came of a noble family belonging to
an Aeolian colony in the Troad. Though Suidas
gives eight possibilities for the name of Sappho’s
father, the most probable is Scamandronymus,
a good Asia Minor name vouched for by Herodotus,
Aelian and other ancient writers and now
confirmed by a recently discovered papyrus.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Note_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
He was rich and noble and probably a wine-merchant.
He died, according to Ovid,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Note_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> when
Sappho’s eldest child was six years of age.</p>

<p>Her mother’s name, says Suidas, was Cleïs.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Note_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
Commentators assume that she was living when
Sappho began to write poetry because of the
reference to “mother” in the “Spinner in
Love”; but this may be an impersonal poem.
According to the Greek custom of naming the
child after a grandparent the poetess called her
only daughter Cleïs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The poetess had three brothers, Charaxus,
Larichus, who held the aristocratic office of cup-bearer
in the Prytaneum to the highest officials
of Mytilene, and, according to Suidas, a third
brother, Eurygyius,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Note_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> of whom nothing is known.</p>

<p>Athenaeus tells us that the beautiful Sappho
often sang the praises of her brother Larichus;
and the name was handed down in families of
Mytilene, for it occurs in a Priene inscription<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Note_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
as the name of the father of a friend of Alexander
who was named Eurygyius. This shows the
family tradition and how descendants of Sappho’s
family attained high ranks in Alexander’s army.</p>

<p>Charaxus, the eldest brother as we now know,
“sailed to Egypt and as an associate with a
certain Doricha spent very much money on
her,” according to the recently found late papyrus
biography. Charaxus had strayed from
home about 572 and sailed as a merchant to
Naucratis, the great Greek port colony established
in the delta of the Nile under conditions
similar to those of China’s treaty-ports. There
he was bartering Lesbian wine, Horace’s <i lang="la">innocentis
pocula Lesbii</i>, for loveliness and pleasures,
when he fell in love with and ransomed the
beautiful Thracian courtesan, the world-renowned
<i>demi-mondaine</i>. She was called Doricha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
by Sappho according to the Augustan geographer,
Strabo, but Herodotus names her Rhodopis,
rosy-cheeked,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Note_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> and evidently thought she
had contributed to Delphi<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Note_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> the collection of
<i>obeliskoi</i> or iron spits, the small change of
ancient days before coin money was used to
any great extent. Herodotus, the only writer
preserved before 400 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> who gives us any
details about Sappho tells the story and how
the sister roundly rebuked her brother in a
poem. Some four hundred years later Strabo,
adding a legend which recalls that of Cinderella,
repeats the story and it is retold by Athenaeus
after another two hundred years. In our own
day it has slightly influenced William Morris
in the <cite>Earthly Paradise</cite>. Except for archaeology,
however, we should never have heard Sappho’s
own words. About 1898 the sands of Egypt
gave up five mutilated stanzas of this poem
which scholars had for many a year longed to
hear, but the beginnings of the lines are gone
and only a few letters of the last stanza remain.
My own interest in Sappho dates from that very
year when I wrote for Professor Edward Capps,
then of the University of Chicago, a detailed
seminary paper on <cite>The Nereid Ode</cite>, and for the
twenty-five years since I have been gathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
material about Sappho. We must be careful
not to accept as certainly Sappho’s, especially
the un-Sapphic idea of the last stanza, the
restorations of Wilamowitz, Edmonds, and a
host of other scholars, who have changed their
own conjectures several times. Wilamowitz
goes so far as to think that the words apply to
Larichus, but most critics have restored them
with reference to Charaxus. I give a version
which I have based on Edmonds’ latest and
revised text,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Note_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> taking a model from the stanza
used by Tennyson in his <cite>Palace of Art</cite>.</p>

<p>In offering a new translation of such songs
as these it should be fully realized that no
translation of a really beautiful poem can possibly
represent the original in any fair or complete
fashion. Unfortunately languages differ;
and in translating a single word of Sappho into
a word of English which fairly represents its
meaning, one may easily have lost the musical
charm of the original, and still further he may
have broken up the general charm or spirit
which the word has because of its associations
with the spirit of the whole song. It ought to
be clear that in preserving the literal meanings
of the words in a song the translator may be
compelled to part in large measure with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
musical note that comes from assonance, alliteration,
and association; or again that in rendering
the music as Swinburne could do, he may
have diluted or even lost the real meaning and
spirit of the poem; and finally that, though the
spirit of the poem may be seized ever so effectively,
the working out of the details of music
and meaning may fail to respond to those of
the original. Of course a slight measure of
successful representation may be attained. But
whatever poetical value anyone senses in these
translations must be almost indefinitely heightened
by imagination, if the beauty, grace, and
power of the original are to be realized. Why
then translate at all? Well, just because of a
desire to make an English reader share even in
a small measure the pleasure the translator feels
in the original and to furnish him with paths
along which his imagination may lawfully climb
toward the height reached by this strangely
gifted woman’s pen.</p>

<p>“Sappho,” or “Sapho,”<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Note_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> as the name appears
on vases and papyri, or “Psappho,” as coins
and vases have it, or “Psappha,” as she herself
spelled it in her soft Aeolic dialect, is perhaps
a nom de plume,—the word meaning <i>lapis lazuli</i>.
According to Athenaeus<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Note_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> (who wrote at
the beginning of the third century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) she
lived in the time of the father of Croesus, Alyattes,
who reigned over Lydia from 628 to 560 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>
Jeremiah, Nebuchadnezzar, and at Rome Tarquinius
Priscus were her contemporaries. Suidas,
a Greek lexicographer of the tenth century
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, says that she flourished about the 42nd
Olympiad (612-608 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>),<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Note_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> along with Alcaeus and
Stesichorus and Pittacus,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Note_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> (<a href="#plate2">Pl. 2</a>) the latter, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of the seven wise men of Greece and lord of Lesbus.
This would indicate that she was then in
her poetic prime. If so, she must have been born
about 630 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> or earlier. Mackail dates her
birth as far back as the middle of the seventh
century. These early dates given above are
amply confirmed by her explicit reference to
Sardis and by her descriptions of the luxurious
life of the Lydians (E.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Note_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> 20, 38, 86, 130, etc.)
which have lately been made so realistic by the
American excavations with their finds of gold
staters of Croesus, beautiful Lydian seals,
jewelry, pottery, and inscriptions.</p>

<p>In the seventh century after the founding of
Naucratis, about 650 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, many Mytilenaeans
migrated to Naucratis and engaged in trade in
wine and other products.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Note_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Among these was
included, as Herodotus’ story shows, Sappho’s
brother Charaxus; the mention of his name
furnishes a further confirmation of the date we
have assumed, and proves that Sappho lived at
least after 572 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, the year of the accession to
the throne of Egypt of Amasis, in whose reign
Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Note_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> says that Rhodopis flourished.
This would make Sappho’s age at the time about
sixty and justify the epithet of “old” which
she applies to herself in the poem given in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Edmonds 99. Fragment 42 in Edmonds seems to
say “age now causeth a thousand twisted wrinkles
to make their track along my face.”<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Note_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> Stobaeus<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Note_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>
tells how one evening over the wine
Solon’s nephew, Execestides, sang to him a song
by Sappho, and Solon requested him to teach it
to him that he might learn it before he died.
Now Solon was one of the seven to whom
Pittacus also belonged. He died about 559 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>
at the age of eighty, and the incident serves to
indicate that Sappho’s poems were coming into
vogue among the young Athenians in Solon’s
old age.</p>

<p>Sappho’s birthplace was Eresus,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Note_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> the birthplace
also of Aristotle’s famous pupil Theophrastus.
She early moved to Mytilene (<a href="#plate3">Pl. 3</a>),
chief city of Lesbus. Lesbus had been renowned
for lovely ladies from Homer’s day, when beauty
contests were held there, as they have been
down to the present time. It had also been
famous from early days for its sweet wine.
Many an ancient author speaks of this wholesome
tipple, and to-day a thirsty traveller is
delighted to sit in a café on the quay and drink
a glass of the fine modern κρασὶ τῆς Μιτυλήνης.</p>

<p>Lesbus was so near to Lydia that it could not
help absorbing some of the Ionian and Lydian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
luxury. No one has better described the
position of Lesbus in Greek literature than
Symonds:<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Note_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For a certain space of time the Aeolians occupied
the very foreground of Greek literature, and
blazed out with a brilliance of lyrical splendor that
has never been surpassed. There seems to have
been something passionate and intense in their
temperament, which made the emotions of the
Dorian and the Ionian feeble by comparison.
Lesbos, the centre of Aeolian culture, was the
island of overmastering passions: the personality
of the Greek race burned there with a fierce and
steady flame of concentrated feeling. The energies
which the Ionians divided between pleasure, politics,
trade, legislation, science, and the arts, and
which the Dorians turned to war and statecraft and
social economy, were restrained by the Aeolians
within the sphere of individual emotions, ready to
burst forth volcanically. Nowhere in any age of
Greek history, or in any part of Hellas, did the love
of physical beauty, the sensibility to radiant scenes
of nature, the consuming fervor of personal feeling,
assume such grand proportions and receive so illustrious
an expression as they did in Lesbos. At
first this passion blossomed into the most exquisite
lyrical poetry that the world has known; this was
the flower-time of the Aeolians, their brief and
brilliant spring. But the fruit it bore was bitter
and rotten. Lesbos became a byword for corruption.
The passions which for a moment had flamed
into the gorgeousness of art, burning their envelope
of words and images, remained a mere furnace of
sensuality, from which no expression of the divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in human life could be expected. In this the Lesbian
poets were not unlike the Provençal troubadours,
who made a literature of love, or the Venetian
painters, who based their art upon the beauty of
color, the voluptuous charms of the flesh. In each
case the motive of enthusiastic passion sufficed to
produce a dazzling result. But as soon as its freshness
was exhausted there was nothing left for art to
live on, and mere decadence to sensuality ensued.”</p>

<p>“Several circumstances contributed to aid the
development of lyric poetry in Lesbos. The customs
of the Aeolians permitted more social and
domestic freedom than was common in Greece.
Aeolian women were not confined to the harem
like Ionians, or subjected to the rigorous discipline
of the Spartans. While mixing freely with male
society, they were highly educated, and accustomed
to express their sentiments to an extent unknown
elsewhere in history—until, indeed, the present
time. The Lesbian ladies applied themselves successfully
to literature. They formed clubs for the
cultivation of poetry and music. They studied the
arts of beauty, and sought to refine metrical forms
and diction. Nor did they confine themselves to
the scientific side of art. Unrestrained by public
opinion, and passionate for the beautiful, they
cultivated their senses and emotions, and indulged
their wildest passions. All the luxuries and elegancies
of life which that climate and the rich
valleys of Lesbos could afford were at their disposal;
exquisite gardens, where the rose and hyacinth
spread perfume; river-beds ablaze with the
oleander and wild pomegranate; olive-groves and
fountains, where the cyclamen and violet flowered
with feathery maiden-hair; pinetree-shadowed coves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
where they might bathe in the calm of a tideless
sea; fruits such as only the southern sun and sea-wind
can mature; marble cliffs, starred with jonquil
and anemone in spring, aromatic with myrtle and
lentisk and samphire and wild rosemary through
all the months; nightingales that sang in May;
temples dim with dusky gold and bright with
ivory; statues and frescoes of heroic forms. In
such scenes as these the Lesbian poets lived, and
thought of love. When we read their poems, we
seem to have the perfumes, colors, sounds, and
lights of that luxurious land distilled in verse.
Nor was a brief but biting winter wanting to give
tone to their nerves, and, by contrast with the
summer, to prevent the palling of so much luxury
on sated senses. The voluptuousness of Aeolian
poetry is not like that of Persian or Arabian art.
It is Greek in its self-restraint, proportion, tact.
We find nothing burdensome in its sweetness. All
is so rhythmically and sublimely ordered in the
poems of Sappho that supreme art lends solemnity
and grandeur to the expression of unmitigated
passion.”</p>

</div>

<p>A young woman of good birth in such surroundings
would be sure to have her love-affairs.
When Sappho was at the height of her fame in
young womanhood, the poet Alcaeus, her townsman,
was also in his glory. We are not told
whether he was older or younger than she, but
probably Sappho was the older and lived before
the political disorders which led to her exile from
Lesbus. Alcaeus was said, perhaps wrongly, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
be her lover. The story is based on the verses
quoted by Aristotle in his <cite>Rhetoric</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Note_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> “pure
Sappho, violet-weaving and gently smiling, I
would fain tell you something did not shame
prevent me,” to which Sappho replied, “If your
desire were of things good or fair, and your
tongue were not mixing a draught of ill words,
then would not shame possess your eye, but
you would make your plea outright” (Edmonds).
Tradition even in classic times represented
her as beloved by Anacreon also,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Note_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> but
the bard of Teos flourished at least fifty years
after the Lesbian poetess. Archilochus and
Hipponax, the famous iambic satiric poets, the
former dead before Sappho was born, the latter
born after she was dead, were also represented
as her lovers by Diphilus,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Note_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> the Athenian comic
playwright in his play <cite>Sappho</cite>. But as Athenaeus
in the third century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> said, “I rather
fancy he was joking.”</p>

<p>Mackail says that “she was married and had
one or more children,” and many of the new
fragments, as well as Ovid, indicate this. A
fragment long known says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I have a maid, a bonny maid,</div>
<div class="verse">As dainty as the golden flowers,</div>
<div class="verse">My darling Cleïs. Were I paid</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<div class="verse">All Lydia, and the lovely bowers</div>
<div class="verse">Of Cyprus, ’twould not buy my maid.</div>
<div class="attr">(<span class="smcap">Tucker</span>)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Professor Prentice<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Note_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> translates this fragment
(E. 130), “there is a pretty little girl named
Cleïs whom I love,” etc., and says that it does
not refer to her own daughter. But there is
no word for love in the Greek passage, and the
ancient interpretation of Maximus of Tyre<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Note_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> is
preferable, especially as Cleïs is definitely mentioned
by Suidas and as the name reappears as
that of a young woman in another of the old
fragments and in one of the new pieces.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Note_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> The
matter seems now to be settled by the recent
discovery on a papyrus (about 200 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) of a
new late prose biography of Sappho which is
so important a source for her life that a literal
translation of it is here given, especially as it
is not in Edmonds’ <cite>Lyra Graeca</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Note_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>“Sappho by birth was a Lesbian and of the
city of Mytilene and her father was Scamandrus
or according to some Scamandronymus. And
she had three brothers, Eurygyius, Larichus,
and the eldest, Charaxus, who sailed to Egypt
and as an associate with a certain Doricha spent
very much on her; but Sappho loved more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Larichus, who was young. She had a daughter
Cleïs with the same name as her own mother.
She has been accused by some of being disorderly
in character and of being a woman-lover.
In shape she seems to have proved contemptible
and ugly, for in complexion she was dark, and
in stature she was very small; and the same
has happened in the case of ... who was
undersized.”</p>

<p>The man whom Sappho married, she herself
also being a person of some means, was said to
be Cercylas, a man of great wealth from the
island of Andrus. Cercylas sounds like concocted
comic chaff, but we can believe enough
of the tradition to say that she was married. A
Russian scholar<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Note_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> made her a widow at thirty-five.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Note_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
Thereafter she sought for love and
companionship among the girls whom she made
members of her salon and instructed in the arts.</p>

<p>Sappho must have had a wonderful personality
or she could not have attracted so many pupils
and companions whom she trained to chant
or sing in the choruses for the marriage ceremony
and for other occasions. She was president of
the world’s first woman’s club. It was a <i>thiasos</i>
or a kind of sacred sorority to which the members
were bound by special ties and regulations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
We have a long list of the members who were
her friends and pupils, not only from Lesbus
but from Miletus, Colophon, Pamphylia, and
even Salamis and Athens. For some of them
she had an ardent passion. When they left her,
she missed them terribly (E. 43, 44, 46). “Is
it possible for any maid on earth to be far apart
from the woman she loves?” She was so jealous
at times that she spited her wrath on her
rivals, especially Gorgo and Andromeda. She
“had enough of Gorgo,” and she scolds Atthis
for having come to hate the thought of her and
for flitting after Andromeda in her stead (E. 55,
81). Suidas tells us that she had three companions
or friends, Atthis, Telesippa, and Megara,
to whom she was slanderously declared to
be attached by an impure affection; and that
her pupils or disciples were Anagora (Anactoria)
of Miletus, Gongyla (the dumpling) of Colophon,
Euneica of Salamis. Ovid mentions
Atthis, Cydro, and Anactoria, the name which
Swinburne took for his poem in which he welded
together many of Sappho’s fragments with fine
expression and passionate thought. Maximus
of Tyre (xxiv, 9) says: “What Alcibiades,
Charmides, and Phaedrus were to Socrates,
Gyrinna, Atthis and Anactoria were to Sappho,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and what his rival craftsmen, Prodicus, Gorgias,
Thrasymachus and Protagoras were to Socrates,
that Gorgo and Andromeda were to Sappho,
who sometimes takes them to task and at others
refutes them and dissembles with them exactly
like Socrates” (Edmonds). Philostratus in his
<cite>Life of Apollonius of Tyana</cite><a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Note_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> tells of Sappho’s
brilliant pupil Damophyla of Pamphylia who is
said to have had girl-companions like Sappho
and to have composed love-poems and hymns
just as she did, with adaptations from the lectures
of her professor. Her own fragments
mention Anactoria, Atthis, Gongyla, Gyrinno
(which perhaps means Little Tadpole),
“Mnasidica, of fairer form than the dainty
Gyrinno” (E. 115), and possibly Eranna.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Note_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
One fragment says, “Well did I teach Hero of
Gyara, the fleetly-running maid” (E. 73). If
this is the famous Hero of the Hero and Leander
story so often pictured in Greek art and on coins
of Abydus, Sappho knew the story of two king’s
children who loved one another long before the
days of the painter Apelles.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Note_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Sappho’s school
of poetry in modern times has been prettily
pictured in a painting by Hector Leroux (<a href="#Page_118">p. 118</a>),
but the best representation of what her school
may have been is given by Alma Tadema (<a href="#plate1">Pl. 1</a>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in his academic and learned classical painting
“Sappho” in the Walters’ Art Gallery in Baltimore.
Archaic Greek inscriptions, of interest
to the specialist in epigraphy, can be read on
the marble seats of the theatre at Mytilene
represented in the picture,—the names of Erinna
of Telos, Gyrinno, Anactoria of Miletus, Atthis,
Gongyla of Colophon, Dika (short for Mnasidica),
and others. I quote the beautiful appreciation
which Professor Gildersleeve has
published:<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Note_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A semi-circle of marble seats, veined and
stained, a screen of olive trees that fling their
branches against the sky, and against the sapphire
seas, a singing man, a listening woman, whose
listening is so intense that nothing else in the
picture seems to listen—not the wreathed girl in
flowered robe who stands by her and rests her hand
familiarly on her shoulder. Not she, for though
she holds a scroll in her other hand, the full face,
the round eyes, show a soul that matches wreathed
head and flowered robe. She is the pride of life.
Nor she on the upper seat, who props her chin with
her hand and partly hides her mouth with her fingers
and lets her vision reach into the distance of her
own musings. Nor her neighbor whose composed
attitude is that of a regular church-goer who has
learned the art of sitting still and thinking of
nothing. Nor yet the remotest figure—she who
has thrown her arms carelessly on the back of the
seat and is looking out on the waters as if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
would bring her something. A critic tells us that
the object of the poet is to enlist Sappho’s support
in a political scheme of which he is the leader, if
not the chief prophet, and he has come to Sappho’s
school in Lesbos with the hope of securing another
voice and other songs to advocate the views of his
party. The critic seems to have been in the artist’s
secret, and yet Alma Tadema painted better than
he knew. Alkaios is not trying to win Sappho’s
help in campaign lyrics. The young poet is singing
to the priestess of the Muses a new song with a
new rhythm, and as she hears it, she feels that
there is a strain of balanced strength in it she has
not reached: it is the first revelation to her of the
rhythm that masters her own. True, when Alkaios
afterwards sought not her help in politics, but her
heart in love, and wooed her in that rhythm, she
too had caught the music and answered him in his
own music.”</p>

<h2 id="III_THE_LEGENDARY_FRINGE">III. THE LEGENDARY FRINGE<br />
<span class="smcap">Sappho’s Physical Appearance, The Phaon
Story, The Vice Idea</span></h2>

<p>So far we have been dealing with
ascertained facts, reasonable inferences as
to other facts, and strong probabilities:
in a word, with the real Sappho so far as her
history can be made out with at least some
measure of certainty. There is, however, a
legendary fringe attaching to every great outstanding
personality. It is one of the penalties
of personal or literary greatness to become the
centre of fanciful stories, personal detraction,
misrepresentation, and wild legends often conceived
in a most grotesque and improbable
fashion. To all this Sappho is no exception.
First the question will be discussed whether she
was a dwarf. The famous and far-flung story
of Phaon and the Leucadian Leap will then
claim our mention, and thirdly a word must be
said about her character.</p>

<p>According to Damocharis<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Note_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Sappho had a
beautiful face and bright eyes. The famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
line of Alcaeus refers to her gentle smile. So
Burns in his <cite>Pastoral Poetry</cite> says, “In thy sweet
voice, Barbauld, survives even Sappho’s flame.”
Plato calls her beautiful as does many another
writer, though the epithet may refer, as Maximus
of Tyre says, to the beauty of her lyrics, one of
which practically says long before Goldsmith,
“handsome is that handsome does” (E. 58).
The word which Alcaeus employs does not necessarily
mean that she had violet tresses as
Edmonds translates it. It has generally been
rendered as violet-weaving, and it is to be regretted
that P. N. Ure without evidence, in his
excellent book entitled <cite>The Greek Renaissance</cite>
(London, 1921), tells us that Sappho had black
hair, even if Mrs. Browning does speak of
“Sappho, with that gloriole of ebon hair on
calmèd brows.” Tall blondes were popular in
ancient days and Sappho was neither divinely
tall nor most divinely fair. But the ancient
busts, the representations of her as full-sized,
on coins of Lesbus and on many Greek vases,
belie the idea of the rhetorical Maximus of
Tyre who in the second century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> labelled
her “small and dark,” an idea that occurs also
in the new papyrus which we have already
quoted. Some have even interpreted her name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
as derived from Ψᾶφος, “Little Pebble,” i.e.,
short of stature. Undoubtedly the epithet of
Maximus reflects the Roman perverted idea

<p class="noindent">In any case Sappho was no dwarf, otherwise
her deformity would not have escaped the
notice of the Athenian comic mud-slingers and
scandal-mongers who did so much to spoil her
good name. Such is the traditional, not the
real, human, historical Sappho of the sixth
century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The story of Sappho’s love for Phaon is
patently mythological, as indicated by the
legend of his transformation by Aphrodite from
an old man into a handsome youth. There can
be only slight historic foundation for connecting
Sappho with him and making Sicily the
scene of their first meeting. An inscription on
the Parian marble in Oxford says: “When Critius
the First was archon at Athens Sappho
fled from Mytilene and sailed to Sicily.” The
date is uncertain as there is a lacuna in the
inscription, but it is between 604 and 594 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>,
perhaps about 598. The recently discovered
hymn to Hera, <cite>Longing for Lesbus</cite>, lends support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to this story of exile. She may have been
banished by Pittacus for engaging like Alcaeus
in political intrigues. She probably returned
to Lesbus under the amnesty of 581, as her grave
is often mentioned as in Lesbus. There is even
a tradition preserved by the English traveller
Pococke that her own sepulchral urn was once
in the Turkish mosque of the castle of Mytilene.
We have already cited one or two fragments
which seem to show that she had more than
reached middle age. She was old enough to feel
that she should not re-marry, especially if she
had to choose one younger than herself.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Note_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Fragment
(E. 99) is in the style of Shakespeare’s
“Crabbed age and youth cannot live together.”
Nowhere in her poems is there any evidence
that she committed suicide for love of Phaon,
but as her name has started this legend we must
speak of it in some detail. The famous fragment
(E. 108), to judge from the context
where it is quoted in connection with Socrates’
death, seems to give her last words: “It is
not right that there be mourning in the house
of poetry; this befits us not.”</p>

<p>Now let us discuss the supposititious love
affair, to which we have referred, about which
I share the ancient and modern Lesbian doubt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
The ancients tell of Sappho’s unrequited love
for the ferryman prototype of St. Christopher,
the beautiful Phaon. The story is well given
in Servius’ <i>précis</i> of Turpilius’ Latin paraphrase
of Menander,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Note_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> though he does not mention
Sappho by name: “Phaon, who was a ferryman
plying for hire between Lesbus (others
say he was from Chios<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Note_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>) and the mainland,
one day ferried over for nothing the Goddess
Venus in the guise of an old woman, and
received from her for the service an alabaster
box of unguent, the daily use of which made
women fall in love with him. Among those who
did so was one who in her disappointment is
said to have thrown herself from Mount Leucates,
and from this came the custom now in
vogue of hiring people once a year to throw themselves
from that place into the sea.” (Edmonds).
But neither Phaon nor anything connected with
Phaon is mentioned in any of Sappho’s fragments,
though Francis Fawkes and others have
connected Phaon’s name with the Hymn to
Aphrodite. A writer of the second century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>,
Palaephatus,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Note_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> makes the very inconsistent
statement that “this is the Phaon in whose
honor as a lover many a song has been written
by Sappho.” Nor is there any allusion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Sappho’s curing her passion by leaping from the
white Leucadian cliff. Athenaeus<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Note_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and Suidas
go so far as to say that the victim was another
Sappho, and even in the late lists of Leucadian
leapers, in Photius, Sappho is not included.
Who first conjured up a Phaon, we know not,
but the story belongs to folk-lore, and Phaon
appears on Greek vases of the time and style
of Meidias, who is dated by most archaeologists
toward the end of the fifth century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>,
much earlier than Plato’s play (392 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). His
indifference to the many ladies who are making
love to him is well portrayed, especially on
vases (<a href="#plate4">Pl. 4, 5</a>) in Florence and Palermo (<a href="#Page_107">p. 107</a>)<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Note_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>.
The fair Phaon, Aphrodite’s shining star (φάων =
shining), is only another <i>avatar</i> of Adonis, who
appears in similar style on similar vases,
one even found in the same grave with
a Phaon vase. Phaon, I believe, is as
old as the fifth century; but the story of
Sappho’s leap transferred to the white cliffs in
the south of the white island of Leucas,
the modern Cape Ducato, is later. The Cape
is also called Santa Maura, some two hundred
feet high, and even to-day this rock of desperation
is haunted by Sappho’s ghost and known as
Sappho’s Leap (<a href="#plate6">Pl. 6</a>). The legend of the Lesbian’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
leap first occurs in the poet of the Old
Comedy, Plato, who wrote the play called <cite>Phaon</cite>.
Later in the New Comedy, Menander was probably
adorning an old tale to point a contemporary
moral when he produced his <cite>Leucadia</cite> of which
Turpilius, a contemporary of Terence, wrote a
Latin paraphrase. A few anapaestic lines are
preserved by Strabo, who speaks of the Leucadian
Cliff:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Where Sappho ’tis said the first of the world</div>
<div class="verse">In her furious chase of Phaon so haughty</div>
<div class="verse">All maddened with longing plunged down from the height</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Of the shimmering rock.</div>
<div class="attr">(D. M. R.)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Antiphanes probably told the story in both his
<cite>Leucadius</cite> and his <cite>Phaon</cite>; and Cratinus must
have mentioned Phaon, for Athenaeus<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Note_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> tells us
that he told how Aphrodite, beloved by Phaon,
concealed him among the fair wild lettuce, just
as other writers say Adonis was hidden.</p>

<p>The practice of abandoned lovers taking the
leap may possibly have been known even in
Sappho’s day, for Stesichorus tells of a girl
throwing herself from a cliff near Leucas because
a youth had scorned her. By the time
of Anacreon (550 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>), the leap had become the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
symbol of a love passion that could no longer
be borne; “Lifted up from the Leucadian rock,
I dive into the hoary wave, drunk with Love.”
It is the same old story told at every summer
resort about some place called Lover’s Leap, but
in Anacreon nothing is said about drowning.
And legend<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Note_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> says that sometimes wings or
feathers were attached to the person jumping
off the cliff to lighten the fall. In any case the
leap, legendary or not, was not suicide but a
desperate remedy, killing or curing, for hopeless
love. We hear of many who survived the
expiatory leap.</p>

<p>In a stucco fresco<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Note_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> (<a href="#plate7">Pl. 7</a>) (not later than 40
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) in the half dome of the apse at one end of the
underground building in Rome near the Porta
Maggiore, which served for the cult of some secret
neo-Pythagorean sect or possibly as a temple
of the Muses or possibly only as the underground
summer abode of an enthusiast over Greek
poets like the newly discovered underground
rooms of the Homeric enthusiast at Pompeii,
we have possibly an illustration of the Leucadian
leap, at least in symbolism, as personifying
the parting of the image of the soul. Sappho,
lyre in hand, is springing from the misty cliff,
which Ausonius mentions in his sixth idyl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
(<a href="#Page_131">cf. p. 131</a>), and below in the sea is a Triton spreading
out a garment to break her fall. Opposite
on a height stands Apollo, who had a temple
on the spot and to whom according to Ovid’s
<cite>Fifteenth Heroic Epistle</cite> Sappho promised to
dedicate her lyre if he was propitious. Ovid is
the first writer from whom we have the story in
detail. It was often used in later literature,
as we shall see in a succeeding chapter.
Many know Pope’s translation of Ovid,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Note_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> but
if my readers desire to read an imaginative and
humorous circumstantial account of Sappho’s
leap, on which the modern popular idea is
mostly based, they may find it in Addison’s
<cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 233, November 27, 1711.</p>

<p>The moral purity of Sappho shines in its own
light. She expresses herself, no doubt, in very
passionate language, but passionate purity is a
finer article than the purity of prudery, and
Sappho’s passionate expressions are always
under the control of her art. A woman of bad
character and certainly a woman of such a
variety of bad character as scandal (<a href="#Page_128">cf. p. 128</a>
and <a href="#Note_147">note 147</a>) has attributed to Sappho might
express herself passionately and might run on
indefinitely with erotic imagery. But Sappho
is never erotic. There is no language to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
found in her songs which a pure woman might
not use, and it would be practically impossible
for a bad woman to subject her expressions to
the marvellous niceties of rhythm, accent, and
meaning which Sappho everywhere exhibits.
Immorality and loss of self-control never subject
themselves to perfect literary and artistic taste.
It is against the nature of things that a woman
who has given herself up to unnatural and inordinate
practices which defy the moral instinct
and throw the soul into disorder, practices which
harden and petrify the soul, should be able to
write in perfect obedience to the laws of vocal
harmony, imaginative portrayal, and arrangement
of the details of thought. The nature of
things does not admit of such an inconsistency.
Sappho’s love for flowers, moreover, affords
another luminous testimony. A bad woman as
well as a pure woman might love roses, but a
bad woman does not love the small and hidden
wild flowers of the field, the dainty anthrysc
and the clover, as Sappho did. There is, moreover,
in a life of vice something narrowing as
well as coarsening. An imagination which like
Sappho’s sees in a single vision the moonlight
sweeping the sea, breaking across the shore and
illuminating wide stretches of landscape with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
life-giving light, and in the midst of all this far-spreading
glory sees and personifies the spirit
of the night, listening to the moanings of homesickness
and repeating them with far-flung voice
to those across the sea,—an imagination with
such a marvellous range as this is never given
to the child of sodden vice. Here once more is
a woman who made it her life business to adorn
and even to glorify lawful wedlock, and carried
on this occupation in a sympathetic and delightful
strain of dance and song which, however
passionate in their expression, contain no impure
words. It is simply unthinkable that such
a woman should be perpetually destroying the
very foundations of her own ideals.</p>

<h2 id="IV_THE_WRITINGS_OF_SAPPHO">IV. THE WRITINGS OF SAPPHO</h2>

<p>The number of poems or fragments
(<a href="#plate8">Pl. 8</a>) of Sappho has increased from a
hundred and twenty in Volger’s edition
(1810) to a hundred and ninety-one in Edmonds.
“Though few they are roses,” and a marvellous
vitality and mentality permeates their mangled
and marred members. Sappho probably had
her own collection of her poems, but they were
surely not published in a large edition as has
sometimes been said. An introductory poem is
possibly preserved on an Attic vase, but even
of that we cannot be sure. In Roman days
there were two editions, one arranged according
to subject and the other according to metre,
both based on some Alexandrian source much
earlier than the book <cite>On the Metres of Sappho</cite>,
published by Dracon of Stratonicea about
180 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> Sappho wrote many forms of literature
in many different metres, cult hymns or
odes, marriage songs, scolia or drinking songs,
songs of love and friendship, besides her nine
books of lyrics, epigrams, elegies, none of which
has survived or been described by any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
author, iambics, monodies, and funeral songs
like that for Adonis. The Athenian dramatists
even pictured her as proposing puzzles and
riddles. Colombarius, as quoted by Meursius in
his notes on Hesychius, called Sappho the poetess
of the Trojans, the meaning of which has
recently been made clear by the discovery of the
<cite>Marriage of Hector and Andromache</cite>.</p>

<p>The first poem is the <cite>Ode to Aphrodite</cite> which
was cited by Dionysius of Halicarnassus for its
finished and brilliant style,—the style used by
Euripides among the tragedians and by Isocrates
among the orators. Though the rhythm, ardor,
terseness, and noble simplicity can be given in no
translation,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Note_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> nearly every lover of Greek lyrics
has tried his hand at it. Ambrose Philips made
thirty-four words out of the first stanza which
in the Greek has only sixteen; Merivale found
forty-three words necessary; but Tucker and
Leonard with strict compression and simplicity
manage to translate with twenty-three; Gildersleeve
in an unpublished version which I also
quote here, and Fairclough use twenty-four:</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In its rich Aeolian dialect the ode glows with
true Greek fire. Sappho’s words are clear but
far from cold. They are a sea of glass, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
sea of glass mingled with fire such as the Patmos
seer saw from his island not far from Sappho’s
Lesbian home. They enable us to understand
why Byron in <cite>Don Juan</cite> speaks of “the isles of
Greece where burning Sappho loved and sung.”
This is what Swinburne means, when he speaks
of the fire eternal and in his <cite>Sapphics</cite> says that
about her “shone a light of fire as a crown for
ever.” We know from Plutarch<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Note_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> that an
ancient physician, Erasistratus, included this
ode (which has influenced realistic descriptions
of passion from Euripides and Theocritus to
Swinburne and Sara Teasdale) in his book
of diagnoses as a compendium of all the symptoms
of corroding emotions. He applied this
psychological test whenever Antiochus looked on
Stratonice. “There appeared in the case of
Antiochus all those symptoms which Sappho
mentions: the choking of the voice, the feverish
blush, the obscuring of vision, profuse sweat,
disordered and tumultuous pulse and finally,
when he was completely overcome, bewilderment,
amazement and pallor.” Perhaps Sappho
was influenced by Homer’s<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Note_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> description of fear
and she herself surely suggested such symptoms
to Lucretius.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Note_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> We must regard the ode primarily
as a literary product, but its pathological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
picture of passion is hardly secondary. Even
if the symptoms seem appalling to our cold and
unexpressive northern blood, we must remember
that this physical perturbation, as Tucker calls
it, was in no way strange to the ancients. Gildersleeve
put it well in his unpublished lecture
on Sappho, which he so kindly placed at my
disposal and to which I am greatly indebted:
“if a Greek melted, he melted with a fervent
heat, and if this is true of the average Greek
how much more was it true of an Aeolian and
an Aeolian woman, and of Sappho most Aeolian
of all.” Byron refers to this ode when he says
in <cite>Don Juan</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,</div>
<div class="verse">I don’t think Sappho’s Ode a good example,</div>
<div class="verse">Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn</div>
<div class="verse">Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With regard to Catullus’ rendering (LI), Swinburne
in his <cite>Notes on Poems and Reviews</cite>,
speaking of his poem <cite>Anactoria</cite>, says: “Catullus
translated or as his countrymen would now say
‘traduced’ the Ode to Anactoria; a more beautiful
translation there never was and will never
be; but compared with the Greek, it is colourless
and bloodless, puffed out by additions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
enfeebled by alterations. Let anyone set against
each other the two first stanzas, Latin and Greek,
and pronounce.... Where Catullus failed I could
not hope to succeed; I tried instead to reproduce
in a diluted and dilated form the spirit
of a poem which could not be reproduced in
the body.”</p>

<p>Tennyson has given the best paraphrase in
<cite>Eleänore</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent2">I watch thy grace; and in its place</div>

<p>As J. A. K. Thomson says in his recent fascinating
book <cite>Greeks and Barbarians</cite> (London
and New York, 1921), “Sappho, in the most
famous of her odes, says that love makes her
‘sweat’ with agony and look ‘greener than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
grass.’ Perhaps she did not turn quite so green
as that, although (commentators nobly observe)
she would be of an olive complexion and had
never seen British grass. But even if it contain
a trace of artistic exaggeration, the ode as
a whole is perhaps the most convincing love-poem
ever written. It breathes veracity. It
has an intoxicating beauty of sound and suggestion,
and it is as exact as a physiological
treatise. The Greeks can do that kind of thing.
Somehow we either overdo the ‘beauty’ or we
overdo the physiology. The weakness of the
Barbarian, said they, is that he never hits the
mean. But the Greek poet seems to do it every
time. We may beat them at other things, but
not at that. And they do it with so little effort;
sometimes, it might happen, with none at all.”</p>

<p>The passion of love is the supreme subject of
Sappho’s songs, as shown by these first two and
many a short fragment, as for example (E. 81)
where Love is called for the first time in literature
“sweet-bitter.” Some scholars have
credited it to the much later Posidippus, but
he and Meleager took the word from Sappho,
though it may not have been original even with
her. Sappho’s order of the compound word is
generally reversed in translation, but Sir Edwin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Arnold says “sweetly bitter, sadly dear,” and
Swinburne in <cite>Tristram of Lyonesse</cite> speaks of
“Sweet Love, that are so bitter.” Tennyson
also has the same order in <cite>Lancelot and Elaine</cite>
(<a href="#Page_205">pp. 205-206</a>). To Sappho love is a second death,
and in the second ode death itself seems not
very far away. The Greek words for swooning
are mostly metaphors from death, and so we
are not surprised when we read that like death
love relaxes every limb and sweeps one away in
its giddy swirling, a sweet-bitter resistless wild
beast. Here is Sir Sidney Colvin’s translation
(<cite>John Keats</cite>, 1917, p. 332): “Love the
limb-loosener, the bitter-sweet torment, the
wild beast there is no withstanding, never
harried a more helpless victim.” Another
fragment (E. 54) also shows the power of love:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Love tossed my heart as the wind</div>
<div class="verse">That descends on the mountain oaks.</div>
<div class="attr">(<span class="smcap">Edmonds</span>)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sappho’s range of subjects is much greater
than the personal emotions of love, though very
personal and individual feelings predominate.
She touches almost every field of human experience,
so that there is much in her scant fragments
to bring her near to us. The wail against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
ingratitude comes home to those high-strung
natures who do good to others but are sensitive
to every wrong when they have the unfortunate
experience of learning that one’s friends are
sometimes one’s own worst enemies. “Those
harm me most by whom I have done well”
(Mackail). But she is not one of those who
bear a grudge long, her heart is for peace. One
of the few ethical fragments, as Mackail says,
“is a speech of delicate self-abasement, spoken
with the effect of a catch in the voice and
tears behind the eyes;” “No rancour in this
breast runs wild, I have the heart of a child.”
Sappho’s love of sermonizing is seen in her
commandment: “when anger swells in the
heart, restrain the idly barking tongue.” From
Aristotle’s <cite>Rhetoric</cite> Edmonds (91) reconstructs
another fragment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Death is an ill; the Gods at least think so,</div>
<div class="verse">Or else themselves had perished long ago.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In another fragment of a different nature (E.
120) we read: “Stand up, look me in the face
as friend to friend and unveil the charm that
is in thy eyes.” In other fragments we enter
a Lesbian lady’s home and see woman’s love
of dress,—no short skirt for her, for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
“wrapped her all around with soft cambric”
(E. 105). “A motley gown of fair Lydian work
reached down to her feet” (E. 20), or, if we
believe Pollux (VII. 93), it is the Greek love of
fine shoes. No Lesbian butchery for her tender
feet, but she must wear soft luxurious Lydian
slippers: “A broidered strap of fair Lydian
work covered her feet.” Punning on the name
of Timas (precious), another fragment, which
perhaps refers to a statue of Aphrodite in
Sappho’s home, seems to dote on fancy handkerchiefs;
“and hanging on either side thy face
the purple handkerchief which Timas sent for
thee from Phocaea, a precious gift from a precious
giver” (E. 87).<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Note_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> The fragment (E. 21),
“shot with a thousand hues,” refers to dress
rather than to the rainbow. The sight of
beautiful gowns thrilled her: “Come you back,
my rosebud Gongyla, in your milk-white gown.”
Again she says: “Many are the golden bracelets
and the purple robes, aye and the fine
smooth broideries, indeed a richly varied bride-gift;
and without number also are the silver
goblets and the ornaments of ivory” (E. 66).
She coined new words for women; she calls the
chest in which women keep their perfumes and
like things a <i>gruté</i> or hutch (E. 180). Again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
she uses (E. 179) the word <i>Beudos</i> for a short
diaphanous frock or blouse. She is the first to
use the word <i>Chlamys</i>, where she speaks of Love
as “coming from Heaven and throwing off his
purple mantle” (E. 69). Blondes were much
admired among the fair-haired Lesbians, though
Sappho herself was a brunette, and so she herself
mentions (E. 189) a kind of box-wood or
scytharium-wood with which women dye their
hair a golden color. She is fond of cassia and
frankincense (E. 66), and she dotes on myrrh
and royal perfumes (E. 83). She rebukes the
foolish girl who prides herself on her ring.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Note_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
With “a keen swift flicker of woman’s jealousy,”
and well acquainted with the philosophy of
clothes and with the new Ionic dresses introduced
into Lesbus during her own lifetime
at the beginning of the sixth century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>
from Asia Minor, she jests about her rival
Andromeda, the country girl who knows not
how to manage the train of her new gown<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Note_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>
(E. 98):</p>

<p>There is an intimate love of the loveliness of
nature in Sappho, as we should expect of one
resident on an island under Ionian skies where,
as Herodotus (I. 142) says, “the climate and
seasons are the most beautiful of any cities in
the world.” “The many garlanded earth puts
on her broidery” (E. 133). “Thus of old
did the dainty feet of Cretan maidens dance
pat to the music beside some lovely altar,
pressing the soft smooth bloom of the grass”
(E. 114). As Thomas Davidson has so well
said: “every hour of the day comes to
Sappho with a fresh surprise.” We lie down for
a noonday siesta in “a murmurous, blossomy
June,” as Stebbing puts it, in the orchard of
the nymphs where (E. 4),</p>

<p class="noindent">In the Greek, as Edwin Cox says, “the sound of
the words, the repetition of long vowels particularly
omega, the poetic imagery of the whole
and the drowsy cadence of the last two words
give this fragment a combination of qualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
probably not surpassed in any language.” The
beautiful verses about the pippin on the topmost
branch we shall quote below. In another fragment
(E. 3) Sappho sees the stars in a way
which Tennyson echoes when he writes: “As
when in heaven the stars about the moon Look
beautiful.” Or again Sappho’s love of nature
appears in the line (E. 112): “the moon rose
full and the maidens took their stand about the
altar.” In the new <cite>Ode to Atthis</cite> the moon is not
silver (as in E. 3) but rosy-fingered: “after sunset
the rosy-fingered moon beside the stars
that are about her, when she spreads her light
o’er briny sea and eke o’er flowery field, while
the dew lies so fair on the ground and the roses
revive and the dainty anthrysc and the melilot
with all its blooms” (E. 86). Recently (1922)
A. C. Benson in <cite>The Reed of Pan</cite> has combined
fragment (E. 3) with the beautiful half stanza
quoted above, under the title <cite>Moonrise</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">From the dark arms of dusky firs.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In another fragment, which we quote below,
Sappho pictures a spring midnight with almost
astronomical exactness. She loves the sun:
“I have loved daintiness [from childhood]
and for me love possesses the brightness and
beauty of the sun.” William Stebbing in his
<cite>Minstrel of Love</cite> expands the two verses into
ten, the last “Dazzling my brain with gazing
on the Sun.” Sappho knows the golden-sandalled
and queenly dawn (E. 19, 177). She wrote
an ode to Hesperus, the Evening Star, of which
we have only the tantalizing beginning, “fairest
of all the stars that shine” (E. 32). Another
graceful fragment quoted in antiquity to show
the charm of repetition (E. 149)<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Note_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> on the
Evening Star, which comes in Catullus too, has
influenced not only Byron in <cite>Don Juan</cite> but
Andrew Lang in <cite>Helen of Troy</cite> (II. 4) and
especially Tennyson (<a href="#Page_206">see p. 206</a>). “That Greek
blockhead,” as Sir Walter Scott was called,
though he knew more Greek than most undergraduate
students of Greek to-day, even if he
didn’t know the Sappho fragment, expresses
the same idea in the <cite>Doom of Dever Girl</cite>, “All
meet whom day and care divide.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Sappho is fond of birds, the dove, the lovely
or heavenly swallow (E. 122), the nightingale.
The doves drive Aphrodite’s car in the first ode
and in E. 16 “their heart grows light and they
slacken the labor of their pinions.” Ben Jonson
took from Sappho (E. 138) his line in <cite>The Sad
Shepherd</cite>, “the dear good angel of the spring,
The nightingale,” and Swinburne, “The tawny
sweet-winged thing Whose cry was but of
spring.” A fragment published even since
Edmonds’ book speaks of the “clear-voiced
nightingales.” She knows exactly what crickets
do at noon of a summer’s day. Listen to their
song (E. 94), rescued from Alcaeus, to whom
Bergk had wrongly ascribed it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p>We see the woman also in her love of flowers
as well as of birds. Flowers are her favorites and
she worships them with almost the modern
reverence of the Japanese, whom I have sometimes
seen saying their morning prayers to a
beautiful bouquet. Take, for example, this
simple but pretty flower-picture of Sappho’s
(E. 107):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">She sympathizes with the hyacinth (E. 151),
which the shepherd tramples under foot on the
mountain, and uses it in one of the most attractive
flower-similes in all literature. Listen to
this aubade which has been recently found and
very tentatively restored (E. 82). It gives a
delightful glimpse also of Sappho’s ménage:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Sappho, I swear if you come not forth I will
love you no more. O rise and shine upon us and
set free your beloved strength from the bed, and
then like a pure lily beside the spring hold aloof
your Chian robe and wash you in the water. And
Cleïs shall bring down from your presses saffron
smock and purple robe; and let a mantle be put
over you and be crowned with a wreath of flowers
tied about your head; and so come, sweet with all
the beauty with which you make me mad. And do
you, Praxinoa, roast us nuts, so that I may make
the maidens a sweeter breakfast; for one of the Gods,
child, has vouchsafed us a boon. This very day
has Sappho the fairest of all women vowed that she
will surely return unto Mytilene the dearest of all
towns—return with us, the mother with her
children.’</p>

<p>Dearest Atthis, can you then forget all this that
happened in the old days?... (<span class="smcap">Edmonds</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Or take this other example of Sappho’s love of
flowers which Symonds has expanded into a sonnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
too long to quote here. I give Tucker’s new
version:</p>

<p class="noindent">Sappho knows the little and common flowers,
the dainty anthrysc and melilot, the violets and
the lilies (E. 86, 83, 82), but, like Pindar, she
especially loves the rose. Meleager’s garland of
song assigned the rose to Sappho. She says in
one of the new fragments (E. 83): “with many
a garland of violets and sweet roses mingled, you
have decked my flowing locks as I stood by your
side, and with many a woven necklet made of a
hundred blossoms you have adorned my dainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
throat.” Philostratus in his <cite>Letters</cite> (51) says:
“Sappho loves the rose and always crowns
it with a meed of praise, likening beautiful
maidens to it; and she compares it to the bared
fore-arms of the Graces.” Fragment E. 68
says: “Hither pure rose-armed Graces, daughters
of Zeus.” Sappho’s love of the rose has led
earlier collectors of Sappho’s fragments to include
among her verses the famous song in
praise of the rose quoted by Achilles Tatius in
his love romance on <cite>Clitophon and Leucippe</cite>,
which Elizabeth Barrett Browning has translated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">As they laugh to the wind as it laughs from the west!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sappho, however, does mention the roses of
Pieria in the famous lines spoken with characteristic
teacher’s tone, almost in the manner of
Mrs. Poyser. According to Plutarch, in one
passage, the verses are addressed to a wealthy
woman, in another passage,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Note_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> to a woman of no
refinement or learning; according to Stobaeus,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Note_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
to a woman of no education; probably it was
some rich but uncultured Lesbian girl, who
would not go to the Lesbian Smith or Vassar
or Bryn Mawr:</p>

<p class="noindent">For another expanded version by Swinburne in
his <cite>Anactoria</cite> I must refer to Wharton. Sappho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
had known and loved the wee wee maiden
Atthis when she was an awkward school girl,
but now in the bloom of beauty after a sad
parting the fickle Atthis has flitted away to another
woman’s college and clean forgotten
Sappho for a rival teacher, Andromeda; “I
loved you, Atthis, long ago, when my own girlhood
was still all flowers, and you—you
seemed to me a small ungainly child” (E. 48).<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Note_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
“So you hate to think of me, Atthis; ’Tis all
Andromeda now” (Edmonds).</p>

<p>Lesbus was a land of flowers, of the rose and
the violet, “a land rich in corn and oil and wine,
in figs and olives, in building-wood and tinted
marble,” as Tucker says. But this triangular
island (about thirty-five by twenty-five miles)
had mountains rising from two to three thousand
feet at its corners and two deep fiords on its
southern coast. From the northern coast
Sappho must often have looked across the short
seven miles of laughing sea upon Troyland and
thought of the Homeric poems in which Lesbus
played such an important rôle.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Note_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> The air like
that of Athens as described by Pindar, with a
glamor wreathing such cities as Smyrna, was
so translucent that in the northeast across the
dividing sea many-fountained Ida could easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
be seen. It is perhaps an accident that there is
so little mention of mountain or sea in Sappho.
But she was no “landlubber,” as Professor
Allinson would have us believe.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Note_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Pindar and the
other lyric poets were acquainted with the sea
and so must Sappho have known it, as she daily
saw the ships fly in and out of their haven on
white wings (<a href="#Page_82">cf. first stanza of poem on p. 82</a>).
In one of the new fragments (E. 86) we
have a marvellous picture of the sea in
the last stanza of a poem which otherwise,
with its love of flowers, with the beautiful simile
of the rosy-fingered moon, is one of the most
perfect things in literature. The telepathic and
telegraphic sympathy of Sappho startles us and
the wireless message sent by night across the
severing sea, whose sigh you can hear in the
original Greek, anticipates the modern radio.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Note_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
As this is a memory poem, and <cite>Anactoria</cite>, like
Hallam, is “lost,” for the time being at least,
I have followed as a model Tennyson’s <cite>In
Memoriam</cite> in metre, stanza, and rhyming. The
first line seems to be “remembered” in rhyme
as it were after the interval during which the
second and third lines have been made and
rhymed.</p>

<p>This ode alone marks Sappho as a great poetess.
The reasons are: (1) the loving notice of
little and common flowers, (2) the comparison of
Anactoria when surrounded by other women to
the moon in the midst of her surrounding stars,
the bold personification of the moon secured by
the use of the single figure “rosy-fingered,”
(3) sudden and masterful survey of land and
sea, (4) the successful centering of attention
upon Anactoria’s homesickness even in the
midst of such far-reaching beauty of land and
sea, (5) the remarkably forceful portrayal of
what in our day we call thought-transference as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
seen, for example, in Tennyson’s <cite>Aylmer’s Field</cite>
or <cite>Enoch Arden</cite>, (6) and not least important,
the simplicity and sharpness of outline displayed
in the imagery. “Night” is a vague, widely
diffused, mystic thing, but Sappho makes us see
her a thing of many ears and one of them close
to Anactoria’s face. Night does not send a
mystic intimation such as Tennyson’s vibration
of light might indicate. But she speaks right
out in a clear voice that carries far enough to
reach across the sea to Sappho. A seventh
reason is the strange, hot emotion of love and
sorrow and longing that throbs like a pulse in
every line and makes the whole letter a living
creature. Milton said and lovers of poetry have
always agreed that poetry must be simple,
sensuous, and passionate. By sensuous he of
course meant expressed in images involving the
use of the bodily senses. Is there anything in
poetry, ancient or modern, that more exactly
meets Milton’s requirements than these few
lines of Sappho’s letter to her girl friend? Now
if this is evident to the reader of an English
translation, it is vastly more so to one who
knowing the meaning of the words has read them
in the Greek and then read them again because
they were so sweet, and read them a third time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and many times until the music haunts him
like the face of a lover. This will rank with
Matthew Arnold’s verses <cite>To Marguerite</cite> in no. 5
of his series of little poems on <cite>Switzerland</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Yes! in the sea of life enisled,</div>
<div class="verse">With echoing straits between us thrown</div>
<div class="verse center">...</div>
<div class="verse">Now round us spreads the watery plain—</div>
<div class="verse">Oh might our marges meet again!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Who order’d that their longing’s fire</div>
<div class="verse">Should be, as soon as kindled, cool’d?</div>
<div class="verse">Who renders vain their deep desire?</div>
<div class="verse">A God, a God their severance ruled!</div>
<div class="verse">And bade betwixt their shores to be</div>
<div class="verse">The unplumb’d, salt, estranging sea.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Sappho’s last verse also reminds us of Horace’s
<cite>Oceano dissociabili</cite><a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Note_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> and Tennyson’s “bond-breaking
sea.” Fragment E. 41 refers to the
mariner at sea in a storm; and E. 66 pictures
a beautiful scene on the sea, where “Hector
and his comrades bring from sacred Thebe and
everflowing Placia, by ship upon the briny sea,
the dainty Andromache of the glancing eye.”
(Edmonds)</p>

<p>Sappho’s verses are full of color, of bright and
beautiful things. She ranks with Pindar in her
special devotion to gold, not for its value but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
for its fine amber lustre and its permanency
(E. 110). The Cyprian queen of love sits on a
throne of rich color and splendor, with inlaid
wood or metal (E. 1); she “dispenses the nectar
of love in beakers of gold” in what was perhaps
the introductory poem of Sappho’s Wedding-Songs
(E. 6):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Come thou, foam-born Kypris, and pour in dainty</div>
<div class="verse">Cups of amber gold thy delicate nectar</div>
<div class="verse">Subtly mixed with fire that will swiftly kindle</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Love in our bosoms.</div>

<p class="noindent">Aphrodite wears a golden coronal (E. 9), is
herself golden (E. 157), and her handmaid is
golden-shining (E. 24). The Muses are golden
(E. 11), perhaps also the Nereids (E. 36). They
have a golden house (E. 129):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">The dawn is golden-slippered (E. 19); something
or somebody is more golden than gold (E. 60).
“Gold is pure of rust” (E. 109); “Gold is a
child of Zeus; no moth nor worm devours it;
and it overcomes the strongest of mortal hearts”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
(E. 110).<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Note_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> Sappho’s daughter Cleïs looks like
a golden flower (E. 130); “Golden pulse grew
on the shore” (E. 139, cf. O’Hara’s poem
<cite>Golden Pulse</cite>). One of many fragments of interest
to the student of Greek life and antiquities
speaks of “gold-knuckle bowls” (E. 191).<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Note_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
Sappho was cited by Menaechmus of Sicyon in
his <cite>Treatise on Artists</cite> as the first to use a lyre
called the <i>pectis</i>, and she invented the Mixo-Lydian
mode, particularly sensual or emotional,
which the Greek tragedians copied from her.</p>

<p>Sappho makes allusions to children which are
natural and tender (E. 130). In similes she
uses children simply and directly as in <cite>The Ode
to Hesperus</cite> (E. 149) and in the verse, which
may refer to a sparrow and which Catullus
imitated, “I flutter like a child after her mother”
(E. 142).</p>

<p>Sappho from her tender years was inured to
the sorrows as well as the joys of love. Two
of her fragments (E. 111, 135), the first perhaps
a complete poem, represent the loneliness of a
long night spent in vain waiting for a lover.
Cipollini (1890) and others have often set these
to music. They are popular ballads which
Sappho must have used just as Burns did in
writing <cite>Auld Lang Syne</cite>. As Tucker says: “It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
is probable that she is setting one such prehistoric
lyrical idea to new words or recasting
one such vagrom ditty.” He is thinking, I
imagine, of such a Scottish ballad as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Yestreen I made my bed fu’ brade</div>
<div class="verse">The night I’ll make it narrow:</div>
<div class="verse">For a’ the livelong winter’s night</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll lie twin’d of my marrow.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There are a score of versions in Italian, some far
from Sappho, and Ronsard’s good French version;
and many an American or English poet has tried
his hand at translating the lines,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Note_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> which in the
Greek toll like a curfew bell. All too little
known is the rendering by Alan Seeger, the poet
who was killed in battle on July 4, 1916, in his
poem, <cite>Do You Remember Once?</cite></p>

the sympathy of nature in the moaning of the

<p class="noindent">Sappho’s verses are purer, simpler than the frank
poem of Hester Bancroft on an <cite>August Night</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Note_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p class="noindent">The other popular song about a girl in love, in a
metre which Horace imitated in the twelfth ode
of the third book, is as imaginative a description
as anything in Coleridge or Keats with whom the
Maryland poet, Father Tabb, so aptly compares
Sappho. It reminds one of Gretchen’s weaving-song
in <cite>Faust</cite>, and of the English folk-song, “O
mother, put my wheel away; I cannot spin
to-night.” It is beautifully translated by
Thomas Moore, in his <cite>Evenings in Greece</cite>:</p>

<p>Many fragments deal with the Greek myths.
Sappho is one of the first to tell the story of
Adonis, who has his analogy in Phaon. “Woe
for Adonis” (E. 25); “Woe for him of the four
months’ sojourn, Woe for Adonis” (E. 136 uncertain
restoration). Another fragment is presumed
to be Sappho’s and, probably, to be part
of a song sung at the Mytilenaean spring-festival
of the marriage of Adonis and Aphrodite, of
whose counterpart at Alexandria we have an
example in the fifteenth idyl of Theocritus, so
well translated by Matthew Arnold:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">Maidens.</span> Sweet Adonis lies a-dying, Cytherea; what’s to do?</div>

<p class="noindent">O’Hara, Bliss Carman, and many another have
expanded this lament for Adonis which we know
so well from Bion’s <cite>Lament for Adonis</cite> and from
Shelley’s <cite>Adonais</cite>. I quote the poet laureate of
Canada:</p>

<p>Sappho’s knowledge of literature and legend
is also not little. She is well acquainted with
Homer, who very much influenced Sappho’s
language. She knows Helen (E. 38) and her
daughter Hermione (E. 44); “Hermione was
never such as you are, and just it is to liken you
rather to Helen than to a mortal maid.” Or
take this complete letter to Anactoria (E. 38),
who has eloped with a soldier to Sardis, as
beautiful a poem as any of Sappho’s, if not
spoiled in the last stanza by the wrong restoration
of some scholars. The news of its discovery
caused Mr. Osborn to leap out of bed and say
he would fight for Sappho to the last with a pen
dipt in poison. It reminds one of <cite>The Song
of Solomon I. 9</cite>, “I have compared thee, O my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots,”
or VI. 10, “Who is she that looketh
forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as
the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?”
Osborn, Mark Telfair, Marion Mills Miller,
T. E. R., and others<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Note_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> have given poetic
versions in Sapphics of this new poem. Another
rendering seems superfluous, but I
could not resist the pleasure of adding it,
even though in the main less happy than its
predecessors. In some of the lines the love of
far-off Sappho’s meaning has lured me astray
from the nearer English anapaest:</p>

<p>Sappho knows the story of Leda and the egg.
Edmonds (E. 97) reads a new text: “They say
that once upon a time Leda found hidden an
egg of hyacinthine hue.” But I prefer the older,
better version, which O’Hara renders:</p>

<p>Sappho makes a sarcastic reference to Leto
and Niobe as very dear comrades (E. 140), and
gives Niobe nine children of either sex (E. 168).
She knows the love of the Moon for Endymion
in the cave on Mt. Latmus (E. 167); she wrote
about Theseus (E. 169), Prometheus (E. 170),
Medea (E. 185), and Philomela and Procne,
“the heavenly swallow, Pandion’s daughter”
(E. 122). Perhaps Sappho pictured the
story of Hero and Leander (<a href="#Page_31">cf. p. 31</a>). Stebbing
changes the sex of Hero and makes a
long poem on <cite>Champion, Athlete, and Harpist</cite>:</p>

<p>The divinities in Sappho are primarily Aphrodite,
Peitho, Ares, Hecate, Hera, Hermes, Hephaestus,
and the Muses. There is much reverence
in the beautiful Hymn to Hera, the latter half
of which Edmonds (E. 40) has so very tentatively
restored on the hypothesis that this was written
in Syracuse before Sappho embarked to return to
Mytilene on hearing of the amnesty of Pittacus.</p>

<p>Sappho was not only the poet of ardent
love, as we have seen, but the greatest composer
of wedding-songs of antiquity, and much of such
poetry in later days is nothing but a translation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
or a transfusion of Sappho. Her <cite>Epithalamia</cite>
were written for actual wedding ceremonies,
but I cannot agree with a great German critic
who says that they were not literary productions.
I do not mean to say that she published these
songs, for I believe that they were not collected
into a ninth book until later days. We have
already quoted what may be an introductory
poem to the Epithalamies; perhaps even some
of the other fragments which we have mentioned,
such as that perfect weaving-song, which may
reflect the awakening of love in the heart of the
bride, and certainly the verses on the <cite>Evening
Star</cite> (<a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>) belong to her Epithalamies. The
wonderful new poem (E. 66) with its Homeric
genitives and datives and its Homeric forms of
words on the <cite>Marriage of Hector and Andromache</cite>
could be used as a wedding-song at any
wedding:</p>

<p class="noindent">I do not feel that this poem was cold and superficial
as Miss De Courten and some other
critics say, for to me it is a dignified and simple
epic narrative, like the messengers’ speeches in
Greek tragedy, introduced into the midst of
lyrics. It is almost perfect and well worthy of
Sappho. It makes us realize that Sappho’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
activity was broader than we had supposed
and brings her nearer to her predecessors and
successors. It is a unique example, hitherto
unknown, of a lyric narrative with epic intonations,
throwing new light on the history of the
ancient wedding-songs.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Note_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>A rhetorician of the fourth century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>,
Himerius,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Note_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> has an interesting passage which
bears on Sappho’s wedding-songs and helps us
interpret the fragments which are preserved:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So it is time for us, my children, since we are
summoning our Muses to marriage-dance and
marriage-love, to relax the graveness of our music,
so that we may the better trip it with the maidens
in honour of Aphrodite. How hard it is to find a
tune gentle enough to please the Goddess, we may
judge from the poets themselves, most of whom,
though past masters in love-poetry, went as bravely
to the description of Hera as any boy or girl, but
when it came to the rites of Aphrodite, left the
song for the lyre and the making of the epithalamy
entirely to Sappho, who when the contests are over
enters the chamber, weaves the bower, makes the
bride-bed, gathers the maidens into the bride-chamber,
and brings Aphrodite in her Grace-drawn
car with a bevy of Loves to be her playfellows;
and her she adorns with hyacinths about the hair,
leaving all but what is parted by the brow to float
free upon the wayward breeze, and them she decks
with gold on wing and tress and makes to go on before
the car and wave their torches on high.”</p>

<p class="right">(<span class="smcap">Edmonds</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Himerius refers to the mock contests which
were a part of the wedding ceremonies. There
was always an <i>agon</i> or sham fight, as in Greek
comedy, running through the hymenaeal, to be
succeeded in many cases by a real fight afterwards.
The wedding echoed with noise which
suggested the conflicts of prehistoric days when
brides were captives of bow and spear, and all
sorts of characters figured in this drama of real
life. There was place for satire and ridicule as
well as for praise. Even in recent years I have
witnessed in a neighboring island, “Scio’s
rocky isle,” the semblance of predatory warfare
which the Chians keep up during their bridal
ceremonies. And in 1902 I attended a three
days’ Turkish wedding at Chiblak, near the site
of ancient Troy. On that occasion the frequent
shooting and fighting, which resulted even in
injuries to Turks and Greeks, made the noisy
ceremony seem like a battle. In Sappho’s day,
as to-day in the Orient, a wedding was not a
brief benedictory reading by a clergyman. It
was a long-drawn celebration, a prolonged
process rather than a precise pronouncement,
with torchlight processions, dance, and song.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Note_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>
All these features emerge very clearly in
Sappho, where we can trace the whole ceremony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
from the weaving of the bridal bower (<i>pastas</i> =
portico or bower in Himerius as cited above)
to the aubade song of the next morning. Here
is the charming song, sung, in the same metre as
the famous <cite>Linus Song</cite>, by the bridesmaids as
they led the bride to the bridegroom’s bed,
proud of their island and of their Sappho:<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Note_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Then follows a kind of lyrical marriage drama,
the bridesmaids representing the tribe of the
bride, the youths the clan of the bridegroom,
in this respect foreshadowing Catullus’ double
choir. The maidens answer the young men’s
praise by chiding Hesperus, the evening star,
whose coming heralds the union. The young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
men in turn reply with the famous words already
quoted, to which the sequel probably was “even
so bring home the bride to the bridegroom.”
We think of Edmund Spenser’s <cite>Prothalamion</cite>
and <cite>Epithalamion</cite> which have many of the
motives of the Greek epithalamium, with their
reference to Hesper, with their beautiful descriptions
of bride and bridegroom. I quote the
lines about Hymen, which is Sappho’s Greek
refrain, rendered by the word “wedding” in
Edmonds’ version:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Hymen, iö Hymen, they do shout;</div>
<div class="verse">That even to the heavens theyr shouting shrill</div>
<div class="verse">Doth reach, and all the firmament doth fill.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The men praise marriage bliss; the maidens,
virginity (E. 152, “I shall be ever-maiden,”
E. 159, “Can it be that I still long for my
virginity?”). The bride says, “Maidenhead,
maidenhead, whither away?” and the reply is,
“Where I must stay, bride, where I must stay”
(E. 164)<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Note_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>; a wonderful example of the way in
which Sappho treats abstractions and inanimate
things (cf. also E. 80, “Up, my lute divine and
make thyself a thing of speech”). Sappho is
the first to use such a personification<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Note_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> and it
recalls Théophile Gautier in his reverse application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
in <cite>Mademoiselle de Maupin</cite>. At least
it is difficult to think of the young Gautier
independently conceiving the striking figure
that is so characteristic of the genius of the
Lesbian poetess. This is the Frenchman’s passage.
It describes the fair heroine going out
into the world dressed in masculine habiliments
to test men’s fidelity in love:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And, as I rode away down the alley of chestnut
trees, all the puerilities of my girlhood ran along
by the roadside, blowing me farewell kisses from
the tips of their tapering fingers. And one little
spirit in white, in a clear, silvery voice, cried:
‘Madeleine, where are you going? I am your virginity,
dear, but you look so fierce in your boots
and hose, with your plumed hat and long sword,
that I am not sure whether I should go with you.’</p>

<p>“I replied: ‘Go home, sweet thing, if you are
afraid. Water my flowers and care for my doves.
But in sooth you are wrong. You would be safer
with me in these garments of stout cloth than in
airy gauze. My boots prevent it being seen that
I have a little tempting foot; this sword is my
defense against dishonor; and the feather waving
in my hat is to frighten away all the nightingales
who would come and sing false love into my ear.’”</p>

</div>

<p>In amoebean or antiphonic hexameter verses
(E. 150 and 151), as exquisite as Heine’s <cite>Du
bist wie eine Blume</cite>, the maidens liken the virgin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
state to the unplucked pippin, the married
woman to the hyacinth or columbine, with
which Aphrodite is also adorned in the passage
from Himerius. As Tucker says: “a band of
girls mock the men with failure to win some
dainty maiden, and the men reply with a taunt
at the neglected bloom of the unprofitable virgin.
Say the maids (<a href="#plate9">Pl. 9</a>):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">On the top of the topmost spray</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The pippin blushes red,</div>
<div class="verse">Forgot by the gatherers—nay!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Was it ‘forgot’ we said?</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas too far overhead!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Reply the men:</p>

<div class="verse indent1">On the hills where the herdsmen go</div>
<div class="verse">Is trampled ’neath their feet,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And its purple bloom laid low;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and there unhappily the record deserts us.”
These lovely lines are about as well known as
anything of Sappho’s, owing to Rossetti’s
adaptation in his <cite>One Girl</cite>, a title altered in
1881 to <cite>Beauty</cite>, which the reader can find in
Wharton. In modern times, Maurice Thompson,
Gamaliel Bradford, and others have been influenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
by them, though often an un-Sapphic
touch not in Sappho’s verses is given, as in
Bradford’s <cite>Topmost Bough</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Don’t you love me now,</div>
<div class="verse">After I have set you</div>
<div class="verse">On love’s topmost bough;</div>
<div class="verse">God, then I’ll forget you.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The bridegroom now bears off the bride while
the chorus of youths praise the bride and the
chorus of maidens the bridegroom:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">What may I best compare,</div>
<div class="verse">Dear groom, with thee?</div>
<div class="verse">A slender sapling, ere</div>
<div class="verse">It is a tree.</div>
<div class="attr">(<span class="smcap">Edmonds</span>)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But as to-day the bridegroom disappears in the
society column of the newspaper behind the
splendor of the elaborate description of the
bride’s gown, so in Sappho the praise of the
bride is far sweeter than that of the bridegroom.
Recall the lines of Rossetti and these verses in
the metre of one of Catullus’ <cite>epithalamia</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Bride, thy shape is all delight</div>
<div class="verse">And thine eyes shine soft and bright,</div>
<div class="verse">O’er thy fair cheek desire is shed</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And honor showered on thy head</div>
<div class="verse">From the Lady of Love in heaven.</div>
<div class="attr">(<span class="smcap">Edmonds</span>)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Congratulations were offered also to the bridegroom:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">No other maiden lives to-day,</div>
<div class="verse">Bridegroom, such as thine.</div>
<div class="attr">(<span class="smcap">Edmonds</span>)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Himerius seems to be quoting such a song of
greeting to bride and bridegroom: “Bride that
teemest with rosy desires, bride the fairest
ornament of the Queen of Paphos, hie thee to
bed, hie thee to the couch whereon thou must
sweetly sport in gentle wise with thy bridegroom.
And may the Star of Eve lead thee full willingly
to the place where thou shalt marvel at the silver-thronèd
Lady of Wedlock” (Edmonds). Himerius
also tells us that Sappho “brings Aphrodite
in her Grace-drawn car with a bevy of
Loves” to the wedding. And the joy of the
earthly festival is repeated far up among the
clouds of Olympus where the celestial feast is
described (E. 146) in verses the lilt of which
Professor Gildersleeve has thus reproduced in
his unpublished version:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The mixing howl yonder</div>
<div class="verse">Was filled with ambrosia,</div>
<div class="verse">And Hermes ’gan ladle</div>
<div class="verse">The drink to the gods all;</div>
<div class="verse">The gods all uplifted</div>
<div class="verse">Their beakers and pour’d out</div>
<div class="verse">Libations and utter’d</div>
<div class="verse">Fair wishes for bridegroom,</div>
<div class="verse">[For fair bride fair wishes.]</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Stebbing in his <cite>Friends of Man</cite> has the Gods
descend to the modest hall wherein the marriage
feast is spread.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">All the High Gods from Olympus, to bless the Two, descend.</div>
<div class="verse center">...</div>
<div class="verse">By an ample bowl Hermes, deftest of cupbearers, stands,</div>
<div class="verse">Crowning the Gods’ goblets from the full flagon in his hands.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The function of what we Americans used to call
the first groomsman, in the primitive times of
wife-stealing, was to protect the bridegroom from
pursuit and the name “best man” perpetuates
the tradition. In the Greek wedding, where the
passing and closing of the door was so essential
a part of the ritual, he was the door-keeper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
there was much bantering and chaffing at his
personal appearance on the part of the maidens,
who made much use of the same jokes which
have since been applied to the feet of maidens
of Chicago. The feet of the porter were put in
the laughing stocks somewhat after this fashion
(E. 154):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Full seven fathoms stretch the feet of the porter,</div>
<div class="verse">Full five ox-hides were used for his shoe-soles,</div>
<div class="verse">Ten stout cobblers were needed to make them,</div>
<div class="attr">(D. M. R.)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">to which Edmonds would make the ingenious
but doubtful addition based on Synesius “[and
his father lived in other ways an honest life,
but claimed to be better born than Cecrops].”
The door is shut and the mocking subsides, as
all chant for the groom, “Happy bridegroom,
the marriage is accomplished, as you prayed it
should be, and the maiden you prayed for is
yours” (E. 155); and for the bride they sing,
“O beauteous one, O lovely one, thine it is to
sport with the rose-ankled Graces and Aphrodite
the golden” (E. 157). If Edmonds’ tentative
restoration of the end of the first book of
1320 verses is correct, “the maidens spend all
the night at this door, singing of the love that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
between thee, thrice happy bridegroom, and a
bride whose breast is sweet as violets. But get
thee up and go when the dawn shall come, and
may great Hermes lead thy feet where thou
shalt find just so much ill-luck as we shall see
sleep to-night” (E. 47). Evidently the maidens
saw little sleep that night, but finally silence falls
and in the early dawn is heard the last song of
the serenaders: “Farewell the bride, farewell
the bridegroom” (E. 160, 162).</p>

<p>This chapter should not close without a mention
of the epigrams. Many have been attributed
to Sappho, but three especially (E. 143,
144, 145) have been included in most of the
translations. They are, however, written in
normal epic language without any essential
traces of Sappho’s Aeolic dialect. One, which
Wilamowitz would date as late as 400 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>,
according to Edmonds was inscribed on the
base of a statue of a nameless infant, dedicated
to Artemis in gratitude for her birth by her
priestess-mother. I prefer the older interpretation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Maidens, that pass my tomb with laughter sweet,</div>
<div class="verse">A voice unresting echoes at your feet;</div>

<div class="attr">(<span class="smcap">O’Hara</span>’s adaptation)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The epigram on the fisherman (E. 145) is most
unlike Sappho. Fawkes, Elton, Neaves, and
many a modern poet have put it into verse:<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Note_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The two elegiac couplets on <cite>The Dust of Timas</cite>,
who died before her wedding day, are rather flat
and hardly worthy of Sappho’s genius (E. 144);
but if Edmonds’ restoration of one of Sappho’s
fragments as referring to Timas is correct (<a href="#Page_60">p. 60
above</a>), it may be genuine and in that case one
of the very few surviving early metrical epitaphs.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="V_SAPPHO_IN_ART">V. SAPPHO IN ART</h2>

<p>The high regard of the ancients and
moderns for Sappho appears especially
in art. In olden days she was honored
in town-hall and library. Many a statue and
bust of her was erected and she was one of the
few historical characters who were painted on
Greek vases, which even quote her verses. She
was sculptured also in terra-cotta and bronze.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Note_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
It is well established<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Note_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> that her image was engraved
on coins of Eresus and Mytilene,—a
unique honor in early Greek days. Many (<a href="#plate10">Pl. 10,
11</a>) in the British Museum, in Paris, and elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Note_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>
bear representations sometimes of her
head on the obverse with the lyre on the reverse,
and sometimes her full figure standing or sitting.
They differ much in the manner of the arrangement
of her coiffure, some even showing the
hair covered by a kerchief, a fashion still prevalent
in modern Lesbus. They may be traced
back to different types. Those which bear her
name date from Roman Imperial times. In
general Furtwängler<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Note_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> is right in contending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
that it was not the custom to honor distinguished
persons in such a manner before the days of
Alexander. But the beautiful head which
appears on early Greek coins of Mytilene of the
fifth and fourth centuries <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> may easily be
Sappho and not her patron Aphrodite, even in
cases where the type is adapted to that of the
goddess of love. The lyre on the reverse and the
individual features which resemble some of the
busts of Sappho point that way. The beautiful
face on the old coins was copied from some
statue, perhaps one that was even earlier than
that of Silanion. Farnell well says:<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Note_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> “the
later hero cults of Homer at Smyrna, Sappho at
Lesbus, and Aristotle at Stageira reveal the deep
conviction of the Hellenic spirit that science and
art are divine powers.” If the head on these
Mytilenaean coins is really Sappho, it is a silent
but eloquent testimony to the reverence her
name acquired after her death and to the perfection
of her living work.</p>

<p>The oldest possible representation of Sappho
with which I am acquainted is an archaic terra-cotta
relief from Melos in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Note_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
It dates only a few years after Sappho’s time,
and though not inscribed it may represent
Sappho and Alcaeus. Sappho appears as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
slender lady of average height (not of short
stature as Ovid says), dressed in a long Ionic
woven tunic and wearing sandals. She sits with
lyre in left hand and plectrum in right, and the
bearded Alcaeus stands before her with bowl
in left and extending his right hand. He seems
to be expressing with a smile his admiration
of her new poetry, so different from his own
archaic measure. There is probably no reference,
as in the case of the Munich vase from Sicily,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Note_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
to the famous lines which we have quoted
(<a href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>). On this vase the names Sapho (so
spelt) and Alcaeus are painted beside the tall
and stately figures who appear with lyre and
plectrum. Sappho seems to be rebuking with
almost a pouting expression her fellow-townsman
Alcaeus, who bows his head as she speaks
to him the famous lines. This pictorial translation
of her verses and other representations
show her great popularity in Athens in the fifth
century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> This Munich <i>psycter</i> or cooling
mixing-bowl (<a href="#plate12">Pl. 12</a>) for wine may date as late
as 460 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> and has been attributed to a fictitious
lady painter of the Free Style by Hauser, but
his attribution has not been generally accepted.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Note_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
Furtwängler was probably right in
connecting the vase with the Brygus painter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
My learned friend, the great Oxford expert on
vases, Mr. J. D. Beazley writes me that very
likely it was not by the Brygus painter himself,
but surely in his manner. On an earlier vase, now
in the Czartoryski collection in Cracow (<a href="#plate13">Pl. 13</a>),
dating from the end of the sixth or the beginning
of the fifth century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, according to Beazley
a vase roughly related in style to the Nicoxenus
painter, a contemporary of Euthymides, we
have the earliest certain representation of
Sappho.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Note_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> She is a tall, draped figure with
smiling countenance, walking to right and holding
a seven-stringed lyre in her left hand and
a plectrum in her right. She appears on only
this one black-figured vase, which would seem
to indicate that she did not become popular in
Athens till long after her death, when red-figured
vases were the vogue. The story of
Solon adds testimony to the same effect, and
probably a <i>corpus</i> or collection of her writings
used by the later Alexandrian editions was in
the book-stalls at Athens even in the last years
of the sixth century. Otherwise it is difficult to
account for her frequent portrayal on Attic red-figured
vases. The lost Middleton vase,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Note_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> (<a href="#plate14">Pl. 14</a>),
probably of the South Italian (Lucanian) Style,
shows Sappho, whose name is now thus spelt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
seated on a four-legged stool while a nude winged
Eros hastens towards her with a wreath. The
painter probably knew the poems of Sappho
which pictured Eros as bitter-sweet, and
Sappho’s other word-pictures of the sorrows of
love, for he has labelled Eros “wretched.” One
thinks of Horace’s <i lang="la">querentem Sappho puellis de
popularibus</i>. Mr. Beazley, however, suspects
the inscription <i>talas</i>, and thinks that <i>kalos</i>
(beautiful) was written. It is greatly to be
hoped that the vase will soon be found again
so that we can have a rereading of the letters.
On the Michaelis vase in late Polygnotan style,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Note_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>
which is in the Jatta collection at Ruvo in Italy
(<a href="#plate15">Pl. 15</a>), we possibly have an apotheosis of
Sappho. Aphrodite is painted with a cupid on
her right shoulder like the Aphrodite of the Parthenon
frieze, judging the contest of Thamyris.
Near Apollo are three Muses, and near Thamyris
are four. Sappho is evidently leaning for support
on Aphrodite, receiving a little dove from a
little Eros, and is pictured as a Muse herself,
as in Plato’s epigram. On another red-figured
vase<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Note_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> in private possession, Sappho is in the
midst of her pupils.</p>

<p>Several vases even show knowledge of her
writings. The most important is the hydria or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
water-jar in Athens (<a href="#plate16">Pl. 16</a>), dating about 430
<span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Note_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> which Mr. Beazley would put in the group
of Polygnotus, somewhat in the style of the
Hector painter, though not by him. Sappho is
seated on a light-backed chair or <i>klismos</i>; she is
reading from a papyrus roll, while Nicopolis
behind holds a wreath over her head. Two
maidens stand in front, one, Callis, holding a
lyre. Scholars have long tried to make sense out
of the letters on the papyrus, and several, such
as Comparetti and Aly, have considered them
un-Sapphic; but Edmonds, the great English
expert on Sappho, has got a new reading for the
last word and thinks this is column 1 of a book
entitled <cite>Winged Words</cite>, a phrase borrowed from
Homer. The verses are an introductory poem
to Sappho’s works with an invocation to the
Gods, after which follows the verse: “The
words I begin are words of air, but for all that,
good to hear.” I do not feel that the solution is
satisfactory or Sapphic, and an examination of
the vase itself proves that Edmonds’ reading will
not stand; but no one has yet made a better proposal.
On another vase, in the Louvre, attributed
to Euphronius<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Note_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> we have an echo of Sappho
in the words (E. 23), “I long and I yearn.”
A beautiful fifth century cylix (<a href="#plate9">Pl. 9</a>) by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
erudite and versatile Sotades,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Note_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> whose wonderful
signed terra-cotta horse, mounted by an Amazon,
has recently been brought to Boston from Meroe
in Egypt, pictures a girl on tiptoe trying to
pluck the sweet apple which is reddening on
the topmost bough. I have no doubt that
Sotades was illustrating Sappho’s song.</p>

<p>Possibly on the so-called Steinhauser terra-cotta
fragment<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Note_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> the seated figure is Sappho;
she is nude above the waist and holds her lyre
in her right hand. She is looking into the air
enraptured and sublimely inspired.</p>

<p>Many vases have been interpreted as portraying
Sappho and Phaon,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Note_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> but in every case there
is uncertainty about the interpretation. On
two beautiful vases (<a href="#plate4">Pl. 4, 5</a>), the hydria in Florence
certainly by the Meidias painter himself,
and the crater in Palermo of the school of the
Meidias painter, the beautiful Phaon is definitely
pictured.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Note_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> The inscription on the latter,
“Phaon is beautiful,” leaves no doubt in the
matter. But the girl called Chryse or Philomele
is perhaps wrongly interpreted as Sappho.
These vases are probably older than the comedy
on <cite>Phaon</cite>, by Plato (not to be confused with the
philosopher). Phaon is painted as handsome;
all the girls are adorning themselves and making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
love to him, but he has had too much attention
from the ladies and is sick of them (<a href="#Page_40">cf. p. 40
above</a>). On another crater,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Note_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> in Bologna (<a href="#plate17">Pl. 17</a>),
in style not far removed from the vase-painter
Polygnotus, Phaon appears seated at the oar
in a boat, about to take aboard the tall goddess,
who was to give him a perennial antidote against
old age.</p>

<p>Before we leave ancient painting we ought to
mention a picture of Sappho in a garb as a lutist
which the encyclopaedic Pliny assigns to Leon.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Note_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>
We know nothing about him, but he was
probably one of the numerous second rate
artists of Hellenistic times. An epigram in the
Anthology and the Christian Father Tatian<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Note_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
seem to have referred to this portrait. Several
Pompeian frescoes, and one from Herculaneum
representing a lady with a <i>stilus</i> about to write
her thoughts on a tablet, have been named
Sappho. Only in the case of one<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Note_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> do I feel
that there is any probability at all that Sappho
was meant, and in that one Alcaeus appears
standing by the side of the seated Lesbian
poetess (<a href="#plate18">Pl. 18</a>).</p>

<p>There must have been statues and busts of
Sappho, but so many have been called Sappho
without definite evidence that it is difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
know where to stop. We must always bear in
mind that early Greek art in Sappho’s day did
not believe in realistic portraiture and that all
representations of Sappho are “study heads,”
conceptions of later artists. The most famous
statue mentioned in literature is that by Silanion,
the Greek sculptor of the fourth century
<span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, who was so noted for his Plato and
Corinna.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Note_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> We learn from Cicero’s <cite>Oration
against Verres</cite><a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Note_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> and from Tatian’s <cite>Complaint
against the Greeks or Pagans</cite> that this bronze
statue, on the base of which Cicero was still
able to read the epigram, stood in the prytaneum
at Syracuse, perhaps a memorial of Sappho’s
sojourn in Sicily. Cicero tells us that it was
stolen by Verres and praises it highly: “Could
this work of Silanion, so perfect, so refined, so
finished, be in fitter hands public or private
than those of a man so refined and cultured
as Verres?... And how sorely this stolen
Sappho was missed is almost more than words
can tell. Not only was the poetess exquisitely
portrayed, but there was a world-famous Greek
couplet inscribed upon the base.... For the
inscription on the empty base declares to-day
what the statue was, thus proclaiming the
theft” (Edmonds).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>We know from literature of the existence of
two other later statues. We have spoken
(<a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>) of the epigram of Damocharis which
refers to a portrait of Sappho with bright eyes
and mixed expression of gaiety and graveness.
An epigram by Antipater<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Note_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> (<a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>) is thought to
come from a statue at Pergamum and since part
of an inscription found at Pergamum<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Note_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> mentions
Alcaeus, it is a plausible conjecture that
the lost portion contained the name of Sappho.
This is probably the same bronze seated statue
which in the fifth century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> stood in the
gymnasium of Zeuxippus at Constantinople and
which is described by Christodorus in his
Greek Anthology:<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Note_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> “She seemed to be weaving
a well-hymned song, concentrating her
thought on the silent Muses.”</p>

<p>No full-size statue which we can certainly
identify as Sappho’s has been preserved. The
seated lady in the Vatican holding a volume in
her left hand is hardly Sappho, and it is not safe
to call the standing lady with lyre in New York
in the Metropolitan Museum by her name.
It would be interesting to believe, as some do,
that the famous maiden of Anzio in the National
Museum in Rome was Sappho, but some
scholars of repute even go so far as to say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
it is not even a maiden but rather a boy. Others
say that a priestess, not a poetess, is portrayed.
After repeated examination of the original I
have no doubt of her sex and believe the statue
to be that of a poetess, but whether of Praxilla
or Sappho or some other cannot be definitely
stated. We have, however, many Roman busts
of different types<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Note_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> which have been conjectured
to represent Sappho. One type in all probability
is copied from Silanion, as it resembles closely
in the features of the face and the arrangement
of the hair, especially the little curls in front of
the face and in the covering of the head, the
portrait of Sappho on the early coins of Mytilene.
The best example of this type is the bust in the
Villa Albani in Rome (<a href="#plate19">Pl. 19</a>). It has the perfection,
refinement, and finish to which Cicero
referred, and Sappho is “exquisitely portrayed.”
In the Biscari collection at Catania, Sicily, there
is a Roman copy of a head meant to be inserted
in a bust or statue. It is so poorly finished that
it was probably placed in a niche or chapel to be
seen from a distance. The oval face is young
but placid and cold, a characteristic partly due
to the Roman copyist. With its corkscrew
curls and in other respects it is similar enough
to the busts in the Villa Albani and the Galleria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Geographica of the Vatican to be classed with
them. If they represent Sappho, the Sicilian
bust also does. If Rizzo is right that this is a
muse or nymph, then a copy of Silanion’s
statue still remains to be found.</p>

<p>The so-called head of Sappho in the Pitti in
Florence is of a different type, more dream-like,
and may not be Sappho at all. More likely to
represent Sappho are the busts in Oxford (<a href="#plate20">Pl. 20</a>)
and the Vatican. Other busts about which there
is considerable doubt are in Naples, in the Riccardi
Palace, in the Uffizi at Florence, and there
is a double herm in Madrid which has been
called Sappho and Phaon. Of the so-called
Phaon in Madrid, Amelung has recently found
in the storerooms of the Vatican a beautiful
replica, and he has also discovered there another
Sappho bust of the type on coins. In the summer
of 1922 I photographed a bust, which is in
the Borghese Palace, and I think that it may
represent Sappho (<a href="#plate21">Pl. 21</a>). It resembles a colossal
head from Smyrna in Constantinople, the
bust in Naples, and the double bust in Madrid in
its energetic and individualized features, such as
the large nose and thick lips, and in the curl on
the forehead beneath the middle of the fillet.
Rizzo would trace the Naples bust back to about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
420 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> and call it an ideal representation of a
mortal or perhaps even a courtesan. But
Sappho might easily have been represented in
the type of a courtesan or even a muse. The
large bronze bust in New York which has been
published as a portrayal of Sappho can hardly
represent the poetess, even if the bronze is
genuine and has the sanction of great authorities
such as Eisen,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Note_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> Babelon, and André, since it
resembles none of the known portraits of her.
The Romans as well as the Greeks were undoubtedly
very fond of statues of Sappho, and
some day excavators will turn up for us more
authenticated portraits. The recently discovered
Roman stucco relief which we have
already described (<a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>) shows what we may
expect from future discoveries. Even such
articles of every-day-use as scales have weights
in the form of a Sappho head, such as that
recently discovered.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Note_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>What we have said about the uncertainty of
representations of Sappho in ancient sculpture
applies equally to the portrait of her on gems.
Cipollini has listed and illustrated many ancient
and modern gems and miniatures, but even if
those called ancient are forgeries or are from
Renaissance times, the great number of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
shows the unusual influence of Sappho on the
glyptic art in precious stones.</p>

<p>After Roman days Sappho was often pictured
and sculptured in various ideal ways.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Note_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> Space
fails us to discuss the almost endless works of
later art influenced by her name and traditions;
and it seems idle to detain the reader with a
detailed catalogue. But to leave no doubt that
Sappho has had a vast and powerful influence
on art of all ages, I may mention some of the
more important. During the last sixty years
especially, sculpture has paid a frequent and
international tribute to her. Now she is represented
as sad and pensive, now meditating
suicide, now about to make the fatal leap from
the Leucadian rock as in Pietro Magni’s Saffo
(1866), now even as a corpse on the surface of the
sea. Magni’s statue (<a href="#plate22">Pl. 22</a>) was much admired
during his lifetime and it reminds one of the
Roman stucco relief, since it likewise represents
Sappho, lyre in hand and with head wreathed,
standing on the edge of the rock. She is holding
back her skirts with her left hand and looking
seriously at the waters below, with the intention
of stepping off at the next moment. In 1878
the illustrious Lombard sculptor, Francesco
Confalonieri, influenced it may be by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Vatican Agrippina, made a seated statue which
represents Sappho in profile with sad and bowed
head, clasping her hands on her left side, her
lyre abandoned on the floor. France did not
approve of this statue because some years before
Pradier also had sculptured a draped and
dreaming Sappho who was seated on the
Leucadian rock with bowed head and hands
clasped about her raised crossed left leg, her lyre
lying neglected on the rock (<a href="#plate23">Pl. 23</a>). Pradier had
also sculptured a standing, draped Sappho with
bowed head holding her lyre in her left hand,
and supporting her right on an Ionic column on
which rest the rolls of her divine poetry.</p>

<p>The great German sculptor Danneker, who
was so fond of classical subjects and was the
sculptor of the famous Ariadne, chiselled a charming
marble statuette of Sappho (1796). The
beautiful bas-relief in Greek style in the Vienna
Volksgarten, which R. Weyr sculptured for the
Grillparzer Monument, represents Sappho’s farewell.
She stands in drapery like that of the
Erechtheum Caryatids. She is holding a lyre
and kissing good-bye to a girl friend who gives
her a last embrace. A shepherd kneels nearby
and others in the background are recoiling in
fear. She herself stands at the edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
steps in front of Apollo’s temple, and there is
much other Greek architecture in this relief.</p>

<p>In France, Claude Ramey (1801) exhibited a
seated statue; Duret (1806), a Sappho writing
to Phaon; Beauvallet (1817), a bust; Diebolt
(1848), a dying Sappho of noble and poetical
expression. Other statues of Sappho were
made and exhibited in the Salon by Laurent
(1849), Grootaers (1852), Travaux (1852, now
in the Louvre), Aizelin (1853, bronze), Loison
(1859), Grabowski (1859), Clésinger (1859,
three statues, “Sappho singing her last song,
Seated on the Leucadian rock,” “The youth of
Sappho,” and a polychrome statue), Robinet
(1861), Doriot (1872), and Signora Maraini.
In America, too, from the days of Story and
Hezekiah Augur to the bronze doors of the new
Detroit Public Library Sappho has been a subject
for sculpture. Many are the busts which are
inscribed to-day with the name of Sappho, such
as that by A. Gennai in the possession of Mrs.
W. B. Hill of Baltimore, or that by Sheldon.</p>

<p>In painting, though not often a subject for
the greatest painters, Sappho was represented in
Greek and Roman days and ever since right
down to the most famous modern picture of her
and her pupils by Alma Tadema, of which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
have given a description above (<a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>). Several
pictures, such as Titian’s <cite>Sacred and Profane
Love</cite>, have been supposed by great critics
to represent Sappho, but it is difficult to agree
with Poppelreuter that Titian really meant to
paint a Naiad counselling Sappho, who is lamenting
her love in the forest, to take the Leucadian
leap.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Note_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> In some cases fortunately the painters
themselves have labelled them. Raphael is perhaps
the greatest painter who pictured her. He
brings her significantly in his <cite>Parnassus</cite> (<a href="#plate24">Pl. 24</a>)
into juxtaposition with Petrarch, who dedicated
four verses of his tenth eclogue to her (<a href="#Page_136">see p. 136</a>).
She is represented prominently to the left of
the doorway, resting her left arm on it and holding
in her left hand a papyrus roll with the name
Sappho upon it. Other minor painters who
have painted Sappho are Treshain (1683, “The
Adventures of Sappho”), Ansiaux (1801), Ducis
(1812), Vafflard (1819, “Sappho rescued from
the water by a stranger”), Girodet (1828, a
series of compositions from her first love affair
to the legendary leap), Lafond (1831), Vien
(1833, “Sappho playing the lyre,” and “Sappho
reciting to Phaon”), Chasseriau (1850), Chautard
(1855), Agneni (1857, “Sappho rescued
from the water by the Nereids”), Credès (1859),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Kauffmann (two beautiful pictures, “Sappho
inspired by love” and “Sappho talking with
Homer;” these like many of the other pictures
were also engraved). Barrias painted a sleeping,
nude Sappho, with her lyre by her side, and
represents her perhaps repeating the words:
“The silver moon is set; The Pleiades are gone;
Half the long night is spent, and yet I lie alone”
(Merivale). Other painters of Sappho are
Fragonard, Gros, Devosge, Bartolazzi, Picou
(1863), Loir (1864), Chifflart (1865), Bertrand
(1867, “Death of Sappho”), Gastaldi (1873,
“Sappho meditating suicide”), Gleyre (“Couch
of Sappho”). Hector Leroux in his “School of
Sappho” represents her standing in the atrium
of a Roman house, with lyre in her left hand, on
a platform inscribed with the name of the
Lesbian Sappho, evidently giving instruction
to her many friends and pupils who stand and
sit in various postures in the audience.</p>

<p>This is only a partial list and could easily be
extended, but enough has been said to show that
a knowledge of the real Sappho and her writings
and the legends connected with her will help one
to be a sound and intelligent critic of much in
the realm of art.</p>

<h2 id="VI_SAPPHOS_INFLUENCE_ON_GREEK_AND_ROMAN_LITERATURE">VI. SAPPHO’S INFLUENCE ON GREEK AND ROMAN LITERATURE</h2>

<p>If Sappho’s influence on art has been considerable,
her place in literature has been
far more remarkable. Nearly every thought
in her fragments, which were known before the
recent papyrus additions, has been borrowed or
adapted by some ancient Greek or Roman poet
or some modern poet in English, Italian, French,
German, or modern Greek. Even the Spanish,
Scandinavians, and Russians (<a href="#Page_233">p. 233</a>) know her,
though not so well acquainted with her as the
authors of other nations. A very remarkable
thing is that her writings have in all the ages
been almost never unfavorably criticized from
a literary point of view, no matter how her
character was regarded. We have already, in
giving a résumé of Sappho’s writings, cited many
an echo, many a translation, many a dilation or
dilution, but have seen that the real flavor of
Sappho’s Greek cannot be transferred to any
other language. In this and succeeding chapters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
however, some of the names of writers who owe
much to her will be brought together. She
herself was original and coined many a new idea,
many a new word, and perfected a new form of
metre. Just as a modern poet, Tennyson for
example, is indebted to his predecessors, Keats,
Shelley, Shakespeare, for images and ideas,
she was somewhat indebted in language and
thought to Homer,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Note_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> who filled the fancy of
the Lesbians and was himself, probably, born at
the neighboring Smyrna. She took little from
Hesiod, although we find a few echoes of him
which I cite in a note.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Note_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> On the other hand,
succeeding poets of the next hundred years
seem to have taken little from her. Mimnermus
probably knew the second ode, and his
lines are included in the Corpus of Theognis.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Note_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>
If the fragment “Gold is Zeus’ child, no moth
nor worm devours it (E. 110)” is Sappho’s and
not originally written by Pindar himself, then
Pindar took that idea from Sappho.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Note_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> Herodotus
tells the story of Rhodopis, and Plato, who
would exclude poets from his ideal state, makes
Socrates speak in the <cite>Phaedrus</cite> of the beautiful
Sappho as one of the wise ancients, and he calls
her the Tenth Muse in his famous epigram.</p>

<p>Aristotle, who refers to her three times, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
first one definitely to quote her verses and that
twice in the <cite>Rhetoric</cite> (E. 91, 119, and <a href="#Page_159">p. 159</a>).
Aristotle’s pupil Theophrastus, who was also
born in Eresus cites her (περὶ λέξεως, Mayer, 1910)
as the representative of charm in all its forms.
That essential element of charm is emphasized
by Plutarch and by Demetrius, the rhetorician
of the first century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, in his <cite>Essay on
Style</cite>. Another pupil of Aristotle, Chamaeleon
(310 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>), wrote a book about her.</p>

<p>Sappho’s influence was not great in the field
of Greek and Roman tragedy. Aeschylus and
Sophocles betray no acquaintance with her,
but Euripides was considerably affected by her
verses on love. When he writes in <cite>Electra</cite> (l. 67),
“I consider you a friend equal to the gods,”
he is thinking of the first verse of Sappho’s
second song. Plutarch cites Aristoxenus as
saying that the tragedians learned the mixed
Lydian mode from her. In comedy Aristophanes
had a slight acquaintance with her, and
he was thinking of Sappho’s first hymn in his
suffragette play <cite>Lysistrata</cite> (ll. 723 ff.), where
a love-sick devotee of Aphrodite endeavors to
escape from the Acropolis on the back of the
sparrow, Aphrodite’s bird. Epicrates dealt
with Sappho in his comedy, <cite>Anti-Laïs</cite>, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the year 392 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>; and Athenaeus applies the
words of Epicrates to himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And all the songs that Sappho sang so sweetly,</div>
<div class="verse">Breathing of love, I know by heart completely.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><cite>Sappho</cite> was the title of plays by six different
Greek comedians, Ameipsias, Amphis, Antiphanes,
Diphilus, Ephippus, and Timocles. Of
those by Ameipsias and Amphis we have only
a single word, and the fragments of the others
throw little light on the question as to how much
was taken from Sappho herself. To the plays
of Plato, Menander, and Antiphanes on the
legends of Phaon and the Leucadian Leap, we
have already referred (<a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>).</p>

<p>In the Hellenistic Age, after the time of Alexander,
Sappho was very popular. Clearchus,
the Peripatetic philosopher (300 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) drew on
her for his <cite>Treatise on Love Matters</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Note_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> In the
third book of his <cite>Biographies</cite> Aristoxenus, a
writer on music (320 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>), classes her among
inventors as did Menaechmus of Sicyon in his
treatise <cite>On Artists</cite>. He says that “her books
were her companions.”<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Note_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> The third century
<span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> showed a serious interest in the Lesbians,
and Theocritus has many imitations of Sappho
in dialect,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Note_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> metre, and content. In the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
idyl Simaetha’s description of her feelings is
taken from Sappho. In the seventh idyl, the
picture of the farm to which two friends walked
out from Syracuse in order to attend a harvest
home festival, Theocritus is imitating Sappho’s
Garden of the Nymphs, especially in ll. 135 ff.:
“Close at hand the sacred water from the
nymphs’ own cave welled forth with murmurs
musical” (Lang). Probably the eighteenth
idyl on Helen and Menelaus borrowed much
from Sappho, since the first lines seem to be
cited as Sappho’s by Himerius. Line 38, “O
maid of beauty, maid of grace,” is lifted bodily
from Sappho. The twenty-eighth idyl on
<cite>A Distaff</cite> undoubtedly employed Sappho as a
model, and likewise the twenty-ninth and
thirtieth idyls.</p>

<p>Callimachus (270 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) in his first hymn
(ll. 95 ff.) echoes the fragment which influenced
Pindar (E. 100): “Wealth without virtue cannot
make men happy, nor virtue without wealth,
therefore grant both virtue and wealth.” It
was about the same time that a fellow townsman,
Callias, interpreted her poems as well as those
of Alcaeus. Apollonius of Rhodes (260 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>)
knew her, and so did the <cite>Lament for Bion</cite>,
which has been attributed doubtfully to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Moschus (150 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>): “Oh, Bion, Mytilene bewails
thy song evermore instead of Sappho’s”
(III. 91). Bion (100 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>?) in his <cite>Lament for
Adonis</cite> was probably influenced by Sappho’s
words about the dying Adonis (E. 103) and used
in l. 44 the same word as Sappho did in E. 29.
The philosopher Chrysippus (240 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) mentions
her (fr. 36, 69), as does Cicero’s contemporary,
the poet-philosopher Philodemus (60 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). In
fragment 57a he speaks of her, and in an epigram
he uses as an “intelligence test” of an educated
woman a knowledge of the poems of Sappho.
Alexander the Sophist gave a university extension
course of lectures on her poems. A little
later in the Augustan Age the great literary
critic and grammarian, Dionysius of Halicarnassus
(20 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>), quotes the hymn to Aphrodite,
and Strabo calls her a marvel. Living probably
sometime in the first century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, the anonymous
author of the <cite>Treatise on the Sublime</cite>
quotes the second ode. A little later, about
85 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, the golden-tongued orator, Dio, cites
her, and his contemporary Plutarch often refers
to her, in his <cite>Essay on Love</cite>, 18; in his <cite>Dinner-table
Problems</cite>, VII. 8, 2; in his <cite>Moralia</cite>, 243b,
622c, and 406a, where there is a comparison with
the practice of <cite>Paiderastia</cite> of Socrates. Plutarch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
prefers Anacreon, but refers to at least
four of the fragments which are preserved from
Sappho (E. 2, 48, 71, 137).</p>

<p>Among the Romans Sappho was flattered
abundantly, if imitation is the sincerest flattery.
As Tucker says: “the most genuine lyric poet
of Rome, Catullus, and its most skilful artificer
of odes, Horace, both freely copied her. They
did more than imitate; they plagiarised, they
translated, sometimes almost word for word.”
The flattery does not begin until the time of
Cicero, for Latin comedy, unlike Greek comedy,
paid little heed to the Lesbian poetess. Cicero refers
to Silanion’s statue (<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>). Lucretius must
have taken his description at second hand, perhaps
from some medical source, if he did not take
the verses of the second ode of Sappho direct as
his model for his description of fear.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Note_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> Catullus
(84-54 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>),<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Note_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> who caught the Greek rhythm
even better than Horace, translated the same ode
in his famous fifty-first poem, addressed to Lesbia,
and adapted the fragments on the hyacinth and
the evening star in his <cite>epithalamia</cite>, the sixty-first
and sixty-second songs in the Catullian
collection. Probably in the sixty-second he is
imitating a lost poem of Sappho. The verse of
Sappho (E. 142), “I flutter like a child after her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
mother,” referring perhaps to a wounded bird,
has been used by Catullus in his well-known
third poem, on the <cite>Passer</cite>, which probably also
imitated a poem of Sappho.</p>

<p>In XI. 22-24, Catullus was perhaps thinking
of Sappho’s stricken hyacinth, although some
rustic proverb may also have been in his mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
<div class="attr">(<span class="smcap">Robinson Ellis</span>)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">From these lines and not from Sappho herself,
of whom there is no echo in Virgil, Virgil took
his description of the dying Euryalus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And like the purple flower the plough cuts down</div>
<div class="verse">He droops and dies.</div>
<div class="attr">(<cite>Aeneid</cite>, IX. 435)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We are reminded of Robert Burns’ <cite>To A
Mountain Daisy</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">But now the share uptears thy bed,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>We refer on <a href="#Page_9">p. 9</a> to Catullus’ allusion to
Sappho in XXXV. 17.</p>

<p>In the age of Augustus, even if Virgil neglects
Sappho, in Horace (65-8 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) she is re-born.
If Edmonds<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Note_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> is right in his analysis of a passage
in Dio’s <cite>Corinthian Oration</cite>, two fragments
(E. 76, 77) of Sappho are incorporated there
from a poem which Horace imitated in the
same metre:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Exegi monumentum aere perennius.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Edmonds even goes so far as to suggest that
Horace imitated not only the poem written by
Sappho, but its position. For he thinks that
this poem of Sappho was an epilogue to her
collection; and Horace placed his imitation at
the end of the third book, when he probably
thought it would be his last. Horace seems to
be adapting Sappho in the twelfth ode of the
third book (<a href="#Page_202">see Landor’s imitation, p. 202</a>).
He composed twenty-six or more odes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Sapphic metre, which he fitted to Italian measures,
and he does them well, though in colder
Latin. In him</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Still breathed the love, still lived the fire</div>

<div class="verse">Aeoliis fidibus querentem</div>
<div class="verse">Sappho puellis de popularibus.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The meaning is simply that she is “singing
plaintively (or complaining) about the girls of
her country,” perhaps because they did not all
return her love, as Atthis deserted her for
Andromeda (E. 81); not that she complained
of her fellow-maidens for not loving Phaon.
Unconsciously Horace helped to defame Sappho’s
character, for the epithet “<i lang="la">mascula</i>,” in
the <cite>Epistle</cite> I. 19, 28, repeated by Ausonius,
<cite>Idyl</cite>, VI. 21, has led to gross abuse of Sappho’s
good fame.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Note_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> It has no relation to <i lang="la">mascula
libido</i> and should be interpreted in the light of
Statius<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Note_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> as referring simply to the fact that
she was an imitator of the measures of Archilochus
and the equal of men poets. Of elegiac
writers, Tibullus and Propertius (II. 8, 33) were
influenced only in a general way by the personal
and ardent poetry of Sappho’s lyrics. Ovid in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
fifteenth epistle of the <cite>Heroides</cite> pictured Sappho
as a passionate and voluptuous <i>hetaera</i> who
could not win the love of the beautiful Phaon.
With passion she burns “as when through
ripened corn By driving winds the spreading
flames are borne,” and seeks release and ease,
“from the raging seas.” Ovid (43 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>-18 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)
in this letter and also in the <cite>Tristia</cite> (II. 365,
<i lang="la">Lesbia quid docuit Sappho nisi amare puellas</i>)
completed the Roman defamation of Sappho’s
good name begun by Horace, and so led the way
for the modern idea. From this disgrace she
has been rescued by Madame Anne Le Fèvre
Dacier (1681), by Welcker (1816), the bachelor
who loved Sappho’s genius and who by his
chivalrous vindication made himself her knight,
and by Wilamowitz (1896),—her three great
defenders.</p>

<p>Seneca (<i>circa</i> 4 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>-65 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) in his <cite>Letters to
Lucilius</cite> (88) quotes a book of the grammarian
Didymus on the question <i>Whether Sappho was
a prostitute</i>. In the Flavian period, Statius in
his miscellaneous poems, called <cite>Silvae</cite>, mentions
her:<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148a"></a><a href="#Note_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">About the same time Martial (c. 40-104 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)
cites a poem<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Note_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> of Canius on Sappho: “Sappho
the lover praised a poetess: more pure is
Theophila, yet Sappho was not more learned”
(Ker).</p>

<p>In the second century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> Sappho was
especially popular. In the time of Hadrian,
Dracon of Stratonicea wrote a book about
Sappho’s metres. In the days of Plutarch<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Note_150" class="fnanchor">150</a>
the songs of Sappho were often sung at dinner
parties. And Aulus Gellius (170 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) in his
<cite>Attic Nights</cite><a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Note_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> shows us that Sappho was all
the rage in his day as in the time of Plutarch.
It was the custom “after the chief courses were
disposed of and the time was come for wine
... to have delightful renderings of a number
of the songs of Anacreon and Sappho.” In the
second century many writers on grammar, such
as Apollonius Dyscolus and his son Herodian,
Hephaestion (on metre), Demetrius (perhaps
first century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), Hermogenes, Maximus of
Tyre, and Aristides (on rhetoric), Aelian, Pausanias,
and Pollux quote Sappho abundantly.
The great satirist Lucian (c. 120-c. 200 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)
calls her “the delicious glory of the Lesbians,”<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Note_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>
makes her the standard for ladies of learning who
write poems, and has her contribute to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of his pictures “the elegance of life.”<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Note_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> In
<cite>Loves</cite> (I, p. 905) he uses almost the very first
words of the second ode. That Galen, another
writer of the second century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, who knew not
only medicine but also the popularity of Sappho,
was speaking with authority on literature when
he said that Sappho was “<em>the</em> poetess,” is shown
by the fact that most of the papyri with quotations
from Sappho date from his time or from
the third century, the century when Athenaeus
and Philostratus, who cited much from Sappho,
were living.</p>

<p>In the fourth century Eusebius, Themistius,
and the Emperor Julian, as well as Himerius,
often quote her. Ausonius in <cite>Idyl</cite> VI says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Et de nimboso saltum Leucate minatur</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Mascula Lesbiacis Sappho peritura sagittis.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Claudian in his work on the <cite>Marriage of
Honorius and Mary</cite> (ll. 229-235) makes Mary
“never cease under her mother’s guidance to
unroll the writers of Rome and Greece, all that
old Homer sang, or Thracian Orpheus, or that
Sappho set to music with Lesbian quill”
(Platnauer). In the fifth century the Christian
writer Synesius and that compiler of chrestomathies
Stobaeus often quote from Sappho.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
There is nothing to be gained by giving a long
list of the writers on technical subjects to whom
we owe so many fragments of Sappho not found
on papyrus or parchment. Enough have been
cited to prove that Sappho was much read in
the first four and even the fifth centuries <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
Himerius<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Note_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> especially proves her popularity in
the fourth century, for he rewrites many of her
songs in poetic prose and makes much use of
Sapphic epithets and repetitions of words. The
fragments (E. 68, 101) have influenced him in
his <cite>Orations</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Note_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> and in the <cite>epithalamium</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Note_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
which he dedicated to his friend Severus in
354 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, Sappho’s influence is very apparent
(<a href="#Page_88">see above pp. 88 ff.</a>). The bride is likened to an
apple and the bridegroom to Achilles, although
in the fragments preserved we have no Achilles
but rather Ares.</p>

<p>The many epigrams<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Note_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> referring to Sappho,
from Plato’s couplet written in the fourth
century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> to the time of Paul the Silentiary
(who died 575 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), some of which we have
quoted above, bear out the testimony for Sappho’s
continuous influence through these thousand
years; and now we can trace the reading
of Sappho down to the seventh century, thanks
to the finding in Egypt of two manuscripts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
that century (E. 34, 82-86). Probably, however,
Sappho’s works were not much read even as
early as the end of the sixth century. If so, Paul
the Silentiary would never have written the
epigram that appears in the Greek Anthology.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Note_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
I give a literal translation: “Soft Sappho’s
kisses; soft the embraces of her snowy limbs,
soft every part of her, but her soul is of unyielding
adamant. For her love stops at her
lips; the rest belongs to her virginity. And who
could endure this? Perhaps one who has borne
it, will endure the thirst of Tantalus easily.”
As Professor Gildersleeve<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Note_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> says: “Could
Paulus have ever read anything of burning
Sappho? We often envy the Byzantines their
richer stores, but they seem to have been more
familiar with Menander than with the early
lyrists.... Tell us, Pothos and Himeros,
why has Paulus taken the name of Sappho in
vain? We forgive him for playing with Theocritus’
Galatea but he ought to have let Sappho
sleep alone.” Perhaps Paulus had heard of the
question debated in school and society ever
since the days of Didymus; and so he came to her
defence with an interesting compromise on her
tantalizing chastity.</p>

<h2 id="VII_SAPPHO_IN_THE_MIDDLE_AGES_AND_THE_RENAISSANCE">VII. SAPPHO IN THE MIDDLE AGES AND THE RENAISSANCE</h2>

<p>How long after the seventh century
Sappho was read we cannot say, but
in mediaeval days men were either entirely
ignorant of her or had erroneous ideas.
By the ninth century she seems to have become
almost unknown, otherwise the critic and compiler
Photius<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Note_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> would have preserved some of
her works. He refers only to the tradition of her
love for Phaon and the Leucadian Leap, and
to the hypothesis that she was different from
Sappho the courtesan, as she had been branded
by that father of the church, Tatian (about
140 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), who called her a female harlot, love-mad,
γύναιον πορνικὸν ἐρωτομανές. That idea
undoubtedly led to the burning of her books,
according to Cardan, under Gregory Nazianzen,
about 380 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> According to Scaliger, the burning
took place in Constantinople and Rome in
1073. In any case, no manuscript has survived
in Europe; and it is strange that now not even
her legendary adventures with Phaon appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in the popular literature. The <cite>Etymologicum
Magnum</cite> (1000 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>?) mentions her only five
times, but in that way preserves for us five
fragments. After the time of that lexicon and
Suidas, the mediaeval encyclopaedias and the
<cite>Speculum Historiale</cite> of Vincent de Beauvais of
the thirteenth century make no mention of her,
though they cite many another Greek poet.
Georgius Cedrenus (1015 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>?), a Greek monk,
who in his <cite>Compendium Historiarum</cite> said that
she was “the first of the Muses,” is about the
only one of this time who notices her. Anna
Comnena,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Note_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> daughter of the Emperor Comnenus
I, quotes as Sappho’s the verses supposed
to be addressed to Sappho by Alcaeus
(E. 119). And the archbishop Eustathius preserves
a few fragments. Dante makes no
reference to her, unless possibly very faintly
in the verse “le muse lattar più ch’altri
mai.” Boccaccio (1313-1375), who seems to
have been forgotten by modern writers on
Sappho, includes her among his <cite>Delle Donne
Famose</cite>, “ma confortata da più caldo fervore
d’animo (i suoi versi sono famosi) ... e
certamente non sono più famose che la sua
corona le corone dei re, nè le mitre de’ sacerdoti,
nè le lauree de’ trionfanti.” Petrarch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
(1304-1374) mentions Sappho in his <cite>Triumph
of Love</cite> (IV. 25):<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Note_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p class="noindent">In his Tenth Eclogue he dedicated four verses
to her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Altera solliciti laqueos cantabit amoris</div>
<div class="verse">Docta puella, choris doctorum immixta virorum</div>
<div class="verse">Cinnameus roseo calamus cui semper ab ore</div>
<div class="verse">Pendulus et dulces mulcebant astra querelae.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Petrarch’s friend, Domenico di Bandino of
Arezzo (1340-c. 1415), professor at Bologna,
gave her a brief article in his encyclopaedic
<cite>Fons Memorabilium Universi</cite>. The other commentators
on Petrarch ignore her. Giorgio
Merula (1424-1494), Poliziano’s adversary, accepts
the whole Ovidian legend as historical
fact and even adds a new item to Sappho’s life
by giving her a son Didas by her wealthy
Andrian husband, Cercylas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Renaissance.</span> There was now a second
“floruit” of Sappho’s fame, but like her previous
popularity among the Romans the second renaissance
was not favorable to Sappho, and there
was no true understanding of the historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Sappho. It was in the fifteenth century that
Ovid’s perverse epistle was discovered and from
that time on it biased all Sapphic literature.
The great humanist Poliziano knew her slightly
and has left a Latin version of the epigram on
Timas. Domizio Calderini (1447-1477), the
learned though not overcritical humanist, based
his little knowledge of Sappho on an uncritical
use of Suidas. He even falsified Horace’s
<i lang="la">querentem</i> by forging in its place <i lang="la">gaudentem</i>,
and transformed Sappho from the leader of a
sacred sorority into a tribade<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Note_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> or lover of her
pupils, even of the famous poetess Erinna. The
result was that the great injustice done Sappho
by Horace and especially by Ovid was much
aggravated. Thanks to Tatian and Calderini,
working at different times and in different fields,
Sappho was even more misjudged in the seventeenth
century. It would be idle to cite the
many authors who mention or malign her but
who give us little material of literary importance:
Giraldi (1489-1552), Ludovico di Castelvetro
(1505-1571), Giorgio Carraria (1514 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>),
Iacopo Filippo Pellenagra (1517 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), Francesco
Anguillac (1572), who well renders the second
ode, “Parmi quell’uomo equale essere à i Dei,”
Lorenzo Crasso (1625?), Ugo Foscolo (1776-1827),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and many another.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Note_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> One needs only to
read the long account with many references in
the famous <cite>Dictionnaire historique et critique</cite>
(1696) by that learned compiler, Pierre Bayle
(1647-1706), who because of his scepticism
lost his professorship of philosophy three years
before (1693). In his ignorance he assumed
that Sappho must have been bad and repeated
the usual errors about her. I quote what he
says ironically with regard to the charity of
Madame Dacier: “charité de Mlle Le Fèvre
qui a tâché pour l’honneur de Sappho de rendre
le fait incertain; mais je la crois trop raisonnable
pour se fâcher que nous en croyons nos
propres yeux.” Anne Le Fèvre<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Note_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> in 1681 had
made the first real defense of Sappho’s character,
long before Wilhelm Heinse’s <cite>Ardinghello</cite>,
and one hundred and thirty-five years before
Johannes Friedrich Welcker,<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Note_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> who so influenced
Goethe and Comparetti and Wilamowitz.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries Sappho was rehabilitated
and countless works of literature and
art show her influence. Though the old perverse
idea pervades all forms of literature and art in
many insidious ways and Sappho loses her real
personality and becomes a heroine of Romance,
and although the legends connected with her
are given a prominent place in the sunlight, yet
even this proves her great potentiality in
modern times.</p>

<p>The romantic Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837),
who translated passages from the <cite>Odyssey</cite> and
wrote an interesting essay on the <cite>Popular
Errors of the Ancients</cite>, composed also a <cite>Last
Song of Sappho</cite>. In this poem, drawn from
Ovid, he has given the modern reader a strong
impression for better or worse of the stormy
and passionate soul of the great poetess. As
in his <cite>Brutus</cite>, Leopardi is giving his own views
of life, which are biased by his physical affliction;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
but he blends his sorrow with that of nature and
rises, especially in the third stanza, almost to the
heights attained by Aeschylus in his <cite>Prometheus</cite>.
He ends his song with beautiful mysterious
pathos:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">One is reminded of Sappho’s silver moon in
Leopardi’s calm first lines, and also of Sappho’s
autumn fragment in the lines “where in shade
Of drooping willows doth a liquid stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Display its pure and crystal course....”
Leopardi also translated the famous midnight
song (<a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>) and imitated the third fragment in
<cite>La Impazienza</cite>. Carducci’s (1888) comment on
Leopardi is worth quoting: “la poetessa di
Lesbo non fu nè brutta nè infelice come il Leopardi
l’accolse a imagine sua da una tarda
tradizione, e che della bellezza e dell’amore
intese gustò, e cantò più non potesse il Leopardi.”
Leopardi believed in two Sapphos, as
did Zannoni (1822), following the judgment
of Visconti. About 1793, Pagnini (Pilenejo),
wishing to praise Teresa Bandettini Landucci,
likened her to Sappho in genius but not in
habit:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Te rediviva Saffo ognuno estima</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Pari d’ingegno, e d’arte a quella prima:</div>
<div class="verse">Ma per costumi e voglie in tutto sei</div>
<div class="verse indent1">(Vanto maggior) dissimile da lei!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Parini about 1777 dedicated an ode to Lady
Pellegrina Amoretti d’Oneglia on her graduation
from the University of Padua, <cite>La Laurea</cite>, in
which he said that if instead of studying law she
had given herself to literature she would have
been the equal of Sappho. In 1782 Verri published
<cite>Le Avventure di Saffo</cite>, in which there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
paraphrase of the second ode. This romance was
written in good literary style and had some fine
thoughts and considerable Greek atmosphere.
It went through more than a dozen editions,
and was twice translated into French. In 1787
Parini celebrated the seductive qualities of a
Venetian Signora Cecilia Tron in a poem of
which I quote the first two stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">One evening in 1827, as the story goes, the great
Manzoni in the presence of Lamartine called
La Palli, the happy-hearted Italian poetess, a
“Saffo novella.” Eurica Dionigi was called the
“Saffo Lazia,” and Anassilide was named “Saffo
campestre” by the inhabitants on the Piave.
Their verses, however, fall far short of the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Sappho. In 1857 Giovanni Meli published
<cite>La Morti di Saffu</cite>; and many another Italian
writer has published poems in her honor, Gemma,
Cipolla, Botti, etc.</p>

<p>Tragedies on the subject of Sappho in Italy
have been few, among others those of Luigi
Scevola (1815) and Salvatore Cammarono
(1842); that of Leopoldo Marenco (1880)
pictured Sappho as one of the Furies who was
rejected by Phaon when he became enamored
of another woman. Giovanni Pacini (Naples,
1840) first produced an opera on the theme, but
changed the figure of Phaon to one who fell in
love with Sappho and became jealous of Alcaeus,
but was ready to die with him.</p>

<p>In recent years Carducci, in his <cite>Primavere
Elleniche</cite>, makes Sappho and Alcaeus follow
Apollo across the Aegean in a boat drawn by
two white swans:</p>

<p>The influence of Sappho on Italian literature
is also seen in the many Italian translations of
some or all of the fragments; Cappone (1670),
Rogati (1783), Pilenejo (1793), Broglio d’Ajano
(1804), Leopardi (1816), Benedetti da Cortona
(1819), Foscolo (1822), Milani (1824), Zanotto
(1844), Jacopo d’Oria (1845), Nievo (1858),
Viani (1858), Bustelli (1863), Canini (1885),
and others have translated the famous folk-song
(<a href="#Page_78">see p. 78</a>). Giovambattista Possevini (1565),
Francesco Anguilla (1572), Pinelli (1639), Cappone
(1670), Corsini (1700), Conti (1739), Verre
(1780), Pindemonte (1781), Rogati (1783),
Vincenzo Imperiale (1784), Pilenejo (1793),
Tommaseo (1827), Comparetti (1876), Ardizzone
(1876), Fraccaroli (1878), Ambrosoli (1878),
Gemma (1879), Cavallotti (1883), De Gubernatis
(1883), Canini (1885) have translated the
<cite>Hymn to Aphrodite</cite>. Rogati (1783), Gori
(1801), Montalti (1804), Broglio d’Ajano (1804),
Sabbione (1817), Venini (1818), Caselli (1819),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Foscolo (1823), Milani (1824), Costa (1825),
Accio (1830), Monti (1832), Leone (1843),
Nievo (1858), Canna (1871), Fraccaroli (1878),
Canini (1885) have translated or adapted the
second ode. D’Ajano (1804) gave the first complete
version of all the old fragments, and in
1863 Bustelli did likewise,—neither of a high
order of merit. In 1890 Cipollini published his
verse translation of the first two odes and of
the fragment about the Pleiades, which his
brother set to music. The latest translation I
have seen is by Latini (1914) and it is an excellent
piece of work. Italy has had for the last
hundred or more years a high regard for Sappho.
Cipolla, thinking perhaps of Meleager’s comparison
of Sappho’s poems to roses, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent1">Ma i fior più belli</div>
<div class="verse">Eran, Saffo, i tuoi canti, e ben sapevi</div>
<div class="verse">Destinato a durar presso i futuri,</div>
<div class="verse">Tra i più cari, il gentil nome di Saffo.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And Zanotto says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Le corde Lesbie risuonar d’amore</div>
<div class="verse">Per te, donna gentil, vanto di Grecia;</div>
<div class="verse">Et il tuo lamento ancor discende al cuore.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many of the fragments besides those mentioned
have been translated into Italian or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
imitated by Italian writers, as for example
Zanella’s famous imitation, <cite>A donna ignorante</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Montalti (1804) imitated the fragment on virginity
(<a href="#Page_91">p. 91</a>), adding, however, much material
of his own; and D’Oria (1845) expanded
Sappho’s ten words on the evening star into:</p>

<p class="noindent">There is not space to speak further of Sappho’s
influence in Italy; we have said enough to show
that Italian poetry has many echoes of Sappho
and that Italy still takes an interest in the
Lesbian lyrist. Ada Negri with her fiery pictures
of passion is to-day called the modern
Italian Sappho.</p>

<h2 id="IX_SAPPHO_IN_LATIN_TRANSLATIONS_IN_SPANISH_AND_IN_GERMAN">IX. SAPPHO IN LATIN TRANSLATIONS, IN SPANISH, AND IN GERMAN</h2>

<p>We have spoken of Sappho’s influence
on the ancient Latin authors
and especially of Catullus’ translation
and elaboration of the second ode. Horace
also may have translated whole odes, but we
have only Catullus’ preserved. In later days
many of the editions of Athenaeus, Dionysius,
Pseudo-Longinus, Hephaestion, and of the
Anthology included Latin versions, and many
other writers have Latinized the fragments of
Sappho, especially Ausonius, Stephanus, Thomas
Venatorius, Lubinus, Poliziano, and Thomas
Moore. One of Moore’s two versions of Plato’s
epigram is quoted here:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Musas esse novem referunt, sed prorsus aberrant.</div>
<div class="verse">Lesbia jam Sappho Pieriis est decima.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Among the Latin translators of the odes have
been Elias Andreas, Simone Bircovio, Professor
Le Fèvre (Tanaquillus Faber), Zacharias Pearce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Valentini, Barbagallo and Allucci, Ambrocio,
Emilio Porto and Birkow, etc. Gorsse, A.
Stace, Vossius, and Henri Etienne and others
have rendered the second ode into Latin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spanish.</span> In Spain in 1794 there was a translation
of Sappho and many other Greek lyric
poets into Castilian verse by D. Jos. y D.
Bernabé Canga Arguelles; and in 1832 appeared
a prose and verse translation of Anacreon,
Sappho, and Tyrtaeus by D. Jose del Castilla
y Ayensa. Recently in Paris (1913) has been
printed a modern Spanish version by T. Meabe.
But in general Sappho has had but little influence
on Spanish and German literatures, as
compared with her great effect on Italian,
French, and English. Mention, however, must
not be omitted of the account of Sappho by
A. Fernandez Merino. It is written in Spanish
and discusses many of the Sapphic problems,
giving full references.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">German.</span> In 1710 Philander von der Linde
translated the second ode, and in 1732 Hudemann
translated a few of the fragments, and
there were good German editions of all Sappho’s
fragments as early as the careful one by Christian
Wolf (1734). In 1744 appeared Neukirch’s
translation of the first two odes, and in 1746<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Götz published his translation in rhymeless
verse. In the same year appeared Stählin’s
translations. In 1764 “the German Sappho,”
Die Karshin, mentions Sappho five or six times
and Phaon, but has no direct echoes. In 1776
Meinecke put Sappho into verse; in 1782 Ramler;
in 1783 Günther Wahl. In 1787 verse
translations were published at Berlin and Liebau,
and in 1793 Conz published his translation
of the fragment, <cite>To an Ignorant Girl</cite>. In 1809
Friedrich Gottlieb Born edited an edition for
schools; in the same year C. Braun translated
the fragments; in 1810 Volger published his
very important and rare edition with commentary
and musical schemes. He was soon followed
by Welcker’s defense (1816), which
Goethe mentions four times. But Sappho’s
poetry remained a closed book to Goethe.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166a"></a><a href="#Note_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
There were many succeeding editions or translations:
Degen (1821), Neue (1827), Brockhausen’s
verse imitations (1827), Richter (1833), Jäger
(1836), Gerhard’s free rendering for German student
songs (1847), Köchly (1851), Hartung
(1857), Weise (1878), Theodor Bergk’s great
edition of 1882 reprinted in 1914; Schultz-Geffcken’s
<cite>Altgriechische Lyrik im deutschen
Reim</cite> (1895), Stowasser, <cite>Griechenlyrik in deutsche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Verse übertragen</cite> (1910); and Wilamowitz, <cite>Sappho
und Simonides</cite> (1913). There is a good
German account of Sappho by Paul Brandt
in his <cite>Sappho, ein Lebensbild aus den Frühlingstagen
altgriechischer Dichtung</cite> (1905). In <cite>Griechische
Lyrik</cite> (1920) Erich Bethe in a good
chapter on Sappho translates into rhymed verse
the first two odes and several of the fragments
(E. 99, 119, 135, 114, 54, 71, as well as the new
papyrus fragments E. 83, 149, 150, 148, 154).</p>

<p>I can quote here only the new fragment 83:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>There are only a few distinct cases of Sappho’s
influence on the great German poets, and so I
limit myself to comparing Grillparzer’s melodramatic
adaptation of the Aphrodite ode with
the beautiful rendering by the German lyric
poet of modern times, Geibel, who as a tutor
in Athens learned to love Lesbian lyrics and
Greek literature, though he could not reproduce
the wonderful soft sound of the Aeolic Greek:</p>

<p class="noindent">In 1793, Franz von Kleist at the age of twenty-four
had written a tragedy <cite>Sappho</cite>, a typical
eighteenth century play of intrigue, an immature
performance, however, lacking in clear
portrayals of character and in dramatic development.
In 1816 F. W. Gubitz had published an
unimportant monodrama <cite>Sappho</cite>, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
almost a caricature of what a dramatic work of
art should be. In these dramas there was little
of the real <cite>Sappho</cite>, but the case is different with
Grillparzer’s Sappho, which was given April 21,
1818, in Vienna with great success. Some of the
motives of von Kleist reappear in Grillparzer,
and there are resemblances in language and
thought. He may have used Amalie vom
Imhoff’s <cite>Die Schwestern von Lesbos</cite> (1801), where
there is a reference to the Leucadian Leap.
But he rises to higher heights, and if he did
use the above authors, their “crude ore,” as
one critic has expressed it, “yields pure gold.”
Grillparzer tells us himself in his autobiography<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Note_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>
how he conceived the idea of the drama.
On June 29, 1817, he was strolling along the
banks of the Danube when at the entrance
to the Prater, the great park of Vienna, he met
Dr. Joël, who remarked that Weigel, the orchestra-leader,
wanted a libretto. Dr. Joël stated
that Sappho would be a good subject, and
Grillparzer immediately replied that it certainly
would make a good tragedy. They parted company,
and Grillparzer walked deep into the
Prater, and when he returned home late in the
evening the plan of Sappho was complete. The
next day he went to the Imperial Library and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
secured a copy of the extant fragments of
Sappho, in which he found one of the two
complete poems, which is addressed to the goddess
of love, entirely suited to his purpose. He
translated it at once, and the very next morning
began work on the drama. The spirit of the
play is German, not Greek, and takes some
motives from Goethe’s <cite>Tasso</cite>. But Sappho is
depicted as a woman rather than a poetess, and
the story of the tragedy is really that of an unhappy
woman disappointed in love. While it
is a genuine love-tragedy, it also portrays the
hard lot of the poet and the struggle between
art and life even more vigorously than Goethe’s
<cite>Tasso</cite> did. At the very beginning of the play
Sappho has been crowned with the wreath of
victory at the Olympic games and meets Phaon,
who is represented as only slightly younger.
Carried away by her triumph, he throws himself
into her arms, only to spurn her later. To
Phaon she sings (Act I, vi) Sappho’s hymn to
Aphrodite, which we have just quoted, with a
few changes to adapt it to the situation. Of
course there were no such contests at Olympia
in Sappho’s day, and Sappho’s victory is a pure
invention. Neither was the original hymn
addressed to Phaon, nor did the usual legend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
say that Sappho cast herself from a Lesbian cliff;
but Grillparzer must preserve the three unities,
and such dramatic licenses and many anachronisms,
such as the mention of Croesus who
lived after Sappho’s time, are permissible to a
master of dramatic technique. What interests
us is that Grillparzer actually studied Sappho’s
fragments and was much assisted by them.
In Act I, lines 173 ff., he seems to be referring to
the Adonis fragments, including the one on the
loneliness of midnight, and to the verses which
name Andromeda and Atthis:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">vom schönen Jüngling,</div>
<div class="verse">Der Liebesgöttin liebeglüh’nden Sang,</div>
<div class="verse">Die Klage einsam hingewachter Nacht,</div>
<div class="verse">Von Andromedens und von Atthis’ Spielen.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The fragment (E. 74) is echoed in lines 671-2:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Denn, wenn auch heftig manchmal, rasch und bitter,</div>
<div class="verse">Doch gut ist Sappho, wahrlich lieb und gut.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>While Grillparzer is one of the few German
poets who has imitated the content of Sappho’s
songs, many have tried the Sapphic strophe
with success, especially Wilbrandt in the Adonis
song, in <cite>Der Meister von Palmyra</cite>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Also will’s der ewige Zeus; du musst nun</div>
<div class="verse">Niedersteigen unter die blüh’nde Erde,</div>
<div class="verse">Musst die dunkle Persephoneia küssen,</div>
<div class="verse">Schöner Adonis.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many a German novel refers to Sappho, but
without any special knowledge of her fragments.
One of the most interesting, which adapts with
many changes the Rhodopis story, has been
translated into English, <cite>An Egyptian Princess</cite>,
by George Ebers (A. L. Burt Co., New York,
second German edition 1868). Here Charaxus
actually marries Rhodopis and names their child
Cleïs, who in turn has a child Sappho whose love-scenes
with Bartja make up most of the novel.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Alcaeus, the greatest poet of his day, and
Charaxus, the brother of that Sappho whose odes
it was our Solon’s last wish to learn by heart, came
here to Naukratis, which had already long been the
flourishing center of commercial communication
between Egypt and the rest of the world. Charaxus
saw Rhodopis, and soon loved her so passionately
that he gave an immense sum to secure her from the
mercenary Xanthus, who was on the point of returning
with her to his own country; Sappho wrote some
biting verses, derisive of her brother and his purchase,
but Alcaeus on the other hand, approved, and
gave expression to this feeling in glowing songs on
the charms of Rhodopis. And now Sappho’s brother,
who had till then remained undistinguished among
the many strangers at Naukratis, became a noted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
man through Rhodopis. His house was soon the
center of attraction to all foreigners, by whom she
was overwhelmed with gifts. The king Hophra,
hearing of her beauty and talent, sent for her to
Memphis, and offered to buy her of Charaxus, but
the latter had already long, though secretly, given
Rhodopis her freedom, and loved her far too well
to allow of a separation. She, too, loved the handsome
Lesbian and refused to leave him despite the
brilliant offers made to her on all sides. At length
Charaxus made this wonderful woman his lawful
wife, and continued to live with her and her little
daughter Kleïs in Naukratis, until the Lesbian
exiles were recalled to their native land by Pittakus.
He then started homeward with his wife, but fell ill
on the journey, and died soon after his arrival at
Mitylene. Sappho, who had derided her brother
for marrying one beneath him, soon became an
enthusiastic admirer of the beautiful widow and
rivaled Alcaeus in passionate songs to her praise.”</p>

</div>

<p>We may mention also in closing this chapter
the lyrics, published in a small volume, called
<cite>Stürme</cite>, by Carmen Sylva, the nom de plume
of Rumania’s late queen, because in these lyrics
the tragedy of Sapphic love has a German political
rather than a Lesbian setting.</p>

<h2 id="X_SAPPHO_IN_FRENCH_LITERATURE">X. SAPPHO IN FRENCH LITERATURE<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Note_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></h2>

<p>The poetess of passion, perfect in
expression, is more akin to French
literature than to German, and so it
is not surprising to discover Sapphic echoes in
every period of the former from that of the
erudite and artistic poetry of the Pléiade in the
sixteenth century to the present day of Maurice
Donnay. In the sixteenth century Louise Labé
was composing sonnets which burned like an ode
of Sappho, and in 1556 Remy Belleau in his
<cite>Anacréon</cite> published the first French translation
of Sappho. Only three years later (1559),
another of the Pléiade, Pierre de Ronsard, who
turned from his admiration of Homer and Pindar
to Horace, Anacreon, and Sappho, gave in the
second book of his <cite>Amours</cite>, a translation of the
second ode of Sappho:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Je suis un demy-dieu quand, assis vis-à-vis</div>
<div class="verse">De toy, mon cher souci, j’escoute des devis,</div>

<div class="verse">Souris qui me retient le coeur emprisonné:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Car, en voyant tes yeux, je me pasme étonné</div>
<div class="verse">Et de mes pauvres flancs un seul vent je ne tire.</div>
<div class="verse">Ma langue s’engourdit, un petit feu me court</div>
<div class="verse">Fretillant sous la peau; je suis muet et sourd</div>
<div class="verse">Et une obscure nuit dessus mes yeux demeure;</div>
<div class="verse">Mon sang devient glacé, l’esprit fuit de mon corps,</div>
<div class="verse">Je tremble tout de crainte, et peu s’en faut alors</div>
<div class="verse">Qu’à tes pieds estendu sans âme je ne meure.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Ronsard also translated the famous folk-song,
which has been so much imitated in all literatures,
wrongly calling it an epigram:<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Note_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the second book of his <cite>Poèmes a Christophile
de Choiseul</cite> (Edition Laumonier V, 186), Ronsard
(1556) said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Qui si bien resueilloit la lyre Lesbienne,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Early in the seventeenth century Malherbe
wrote the following stanzas for le Duc de Bellegarde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
“to a lady who imagined that he was in
love with her,” in which he copied from the
Lesbian poetess certain symptoms of love:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Philis, qui me voit le teint blême,</div>
<div class="verse">Les sens ravis hors de moi-même,</div>

<div class="verse">Pâlir, transir, languir pour elle</div>
<div class="verse">Et ne m’en apercevoir pas?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In 1620 Colletet published a prose imitation of
Ovid, entitled <cite>Lettre de Saphon à Phaon</cite> (<cite>Les
Epistres d’Ovide. Traduites en prose françoise.</cite>
Par les sieurs Du Perron, Des Portes, de la
Brosse, de Lingendes, Hedelin et Colletet.
Paris, 1620). In 1660 Le Sieur Du Four translated
the two odes, the first in prose, the second
in verse. In 1674 that great classicist, Nicholas
Boileau, who ranked the ancient writers above
the modern because they had been tested
through hundreds of years and because they
agreed with nature and reason, included a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
beautiful and truly classical rendering of the
second ode, in his translation of the <cite>Treatise on
the Sublime</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Je sens de veine en veine une subtile flamme</div>
<div class="verse">Courir par tout mon corps sitôt que je te vois;</div>
<div class="verse">Et dans les doux transports où s’égare mon âme</div>
<div class="verse">Je ne saurais trouver de langue ni de voix.</div>
<div class="verse">Un nuage confus se répand sur ma vue;</div>
<div class="verse">Je n’entends plus, je tombe en de douces langueurs;</div>
<div class="verse">Et pâle, sans haleine, interdite, éperdue,</div>
<div class="verse">Un frisson me saisit, je tremble, je me meurs.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In 1677 Boileau’s intimate friend, Jean Racine,
produced his great tragedy in five acts, <cite>Phèdre</cite>,
based mainly on Euripides and Seneca, but
including a translation of Sappho’s second ode,
in Act I, scene 3, where Phaedra says about
Hippolytus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Je le vis, je rougis, je pâlis à sa vue;</div>
<div class="verse">Un trouble s’éleva dans mon âme éperdue;</div>
<div class="verse">Mes yeux ne voyoient plus, je ne pouvois parler;</div>
<div class="verse">Je sentis tout mon corps et transir et brûler;</div>
<div class="verse">Je reconnus Vénus et ses feux redoutables,</div>
<div class="verse">D’un sang qu’elle poursuit tourments inévitables.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Racine’s comment was that he had “rien vu de
plus vif ni de plus beau dans toute l’antiquité.”
In 1649 Mlle de Scudéry in her <cite>Artamène ou le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Grand Cyrus</cite> and also in her letters calls herself
Sappho, perhaps thinking of Sappho as a great
literary writer and with a reference to Platonic
friendship but no conception of Sappho as a bad
character. Bayle rather objects to giving the
name Sappho to a “fille qui écrivoit parfaitement
bien en vers et en prose, et dont la vertu étoit
admirée.” Perhaps Anne Dacier was not then
the first to defend Sappho. In any case, Mlle de
Scudéry gives the wrong idea of the historical
Sappho, for in the tenth volume of <cite>le Grand
Cyrus</cite> she gives a tedious recital of the loves of
Sappho and Phaon. What could be farther
from the real burning Sappho than desiring
“un amant sans vouloir un mari, mais un amant
qui, se contentant de la possession de son coeur,
l’aime avec respect jusqu’à la mort.” The later
French romance, entitled <cite>Les Amours de Sapho
et de Phaon</cite>, also has nothing to do with the real
Sappho. In 1680 Hilaire-Bernard de Requeleyne
(cf. Baillet, <cite>Jugemens des Savans</cite>, IV. 392-393)
gave with the Greek a poetical version, and
in the next year Professor Le Fèvre of the
University of Saumur, the Greek scholar and
translator of Virgil, made another French
translation, which was disloyal to the Greek
and did not deserve the praise which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
been bestowed upon it. On December 1,
1681,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Note_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> his daughter, Anne (Madame Dacier)
published <cite>Les Poësies d’Anacreon et de Sapho</cite>
with notes and a life of Sappho. She believed
in the Phaon story and that Sappho followed
Phaon to Sicily and there composed the “plus
beaux vers du monde,” including the hymn
to Venus; “Tout le monde sçait qu’elle aima
Phaon et qu’elle l’aima d’une manière fort
violente.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Ce qui me fait croire qu’il ne faut pas ajoûter
foy à tout ce que l’on trouve écrit contre elle. Si
elle avoit esté de l’humeur dont on l’a dépeinte, il
n’y a point d’apparence qu’elle eût eu tant de
chagrin de l’amour de Caraxus, ni qu’elle eût osé
l’en reprendre avec tant d’éclat. II ne faut pas
douter que son merite ne luy eût fait bien des
ennemis; car elle surpassoit en sçavoir, non seulement
toutes les femmes, quoi que de son temps
il y en eût en Grèce d’extrémement sçavantes;
mais elle estoit même fort au dessus des plus excellens
Poëtes. Je crois donc que ceux dont les
vers auroient esté trouvez incomparables, si Sapho
n’en eût jamais fait, ne furent pas de ses amis, et
que l’envie a fait écrire les calomnies dont on a
tâché de la noircir. Je ne puis même m’imaginer
que les Mityleniens eussent eu tant de veneration
pour une personne si décriée, et qu’aprés sa mort,
ils eussent fait graver son image sur leur monoye.”</p>

</div>

<p>Sappho’s name was in vogue at this time
wherever love was the subject of conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
or of writing. In 1683 Bernard le Bovier de
Fontenelle in his <cite>Dialogues des morts</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Note_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> a title
taken from Lucian, has <i>Sapho</i> and <i>Laure</i> discuss
which sex should be the aggressor in love-making.
Fontenelle displays no knowledge of
Sappho herself, but has chosen her name, like
so many writers even down to the time of
Alphonse Daudet, to lend importance to a story
which has already been conceived and for which
an attractive title must be found. We can only
quote the latter part of the dialogue:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Laure.</span> Quoi! auriez-vous voulu qu’on eût établi
que les femmes attaqueraient les hommes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sapho.</span> Eh! quel besoin y a-t-il que les uns
attaquent, et que les autres se défendent? Qu’on
s’aime de part et d’autre autant que le coeur en dira.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laure.</span> Oh! les choses iraient trop vite, et
l’amour est un commerce si agréable, qu’on a bien
fait de lui donner le plus de durée que l’on a pu.
Que serait-ce, si l’on était reçu des que l’on s’offrirait?
Que deviendraient tous ces soins qu’on prend
pour plaire, toutes ces inquiétudes que l’on sent,
quand on se reproche de n’avoir pas assez plu, tous
ces empressemens avec lesquels on cherche un
moment heureux, enfin tout cet agréable mélange
de plaisirs et de peine qu’on appelle amour? Rien
ne serait plus insipide, si l’on ne faisait que s’entr’aimer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sapho.</span> Hé bien, s’il faut que l’amour soit une
espèce de combat, j’aimerais mieux qu’on eût obligé
les hommes à se tenir sur la défensive. Aussi-bien,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
ne m’avez-vous pas dit que les femmes avaient plus
de penchant qu’eux à la tendresse? A ce compte,
elles attaqueraient mieux.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laure.</span> Oui, mais ils se défendraient trop bien.
Quand on veut qu’un sexe résiste, on veut qu’il
résiste autant qu’il faut pour faire mieux goûter la
victoire à celui qui attaque, mais non pas assez
pour la remporter. Il doit n’être ni si faible, qu’il
se rende d’abord, ni si fort, qu’il ne se rende jamais.
C’est là notre caractère, et ce ne serait peut-être
pas celui des hommes. Croyez-moi, après qu’on a
bien raisonné ou sur l’amour, ou sur telle autre
matière qu’on voudra, on trouve au bout du compte
que les choses sont bien comme elles sont, et que
la réforme qu’on prétendrait y apporter gâterait
tout.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1684 une Demoiselle de qualité de la Province
de Guienne, only eighteen years of age,
published a French prose translation of the two
odes in the <cite>Mercure</cite> for July. In the same year
appeared a metrical translation with Greek text,
philological notes, and a life of Sappho in which
are repeated the stories of disgraceful love,
infatuation for Phaon, and the Leucadian Leap,
<cite>Les Poésies d’Anacreon et de Sapho traduites de
Grec en vers François</cite>. In 1692 we have another
verse rendering by Baron de Longuepierre, who
added a feeble poem in which Apollo vainly
defends Sappho against the arrows of love. In
1694 Despréaux in his edition of the <cite>Treatise on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the Sublime</cite> gave a poetical version of the second
ode which was so artistic that French critics
in their enthusiasm pronounced it superior to
the original, but its rhetorical phrases are far
from the simplicity of Sappho’s Greek. Toward
the end of the grand siècle La Fare, the Epicurean
and inseparable friend of the Abbé de
Chaulieu, translated the famous second ode.
In 1704 appeared a verse translation by De la
Fosse; in 1712 Gacon’s verse translation of
Sappho’s two odes and Father Bougeant’s <cite>Anacréon
à Sapho, Dialogue en Vers Grecs</cite>; and in
1713 appeared in French verse an imaginary
epistle of Sappho to Phaon (<cite>Mercure</cite> for April).
In 1716 La Fosse published his verses based on
those of the Le Fèvres. In 1758 Poinsinet de
Sivry produced his good verse translations.
Voltaire (1694-1778) made an elegant adaptation
of the second ode, with his eye also on
Theocritus’ second idyl:</p>

<p class="noindent">In 1766 appeared Blin de Sainmore’s <cite>Lettres de
Sapho a Phaon</cite> with an account of Sappho’s
life and verse translations of her poems. In
1773 appeared a new version of Sappho in prose
by Moutonnet de Clairfons which proved so
popular that it went through at least seven
editions. In 1798 Mérard de Saint-Just published
his verse translations of Sappho and
Anacreon. Toward the end of the eighteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Note_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> an imaginary Greek manuscript,
said to have been found at Herculaneum, translated
by de Lantier, was published under the
title <cite>Voyages d’Antenor en Grèce et en Asie</cite>, a most
interesting and learned story of an imaginary
trip to Grecian lands. Antenor and Phanor
in the first chapter of the second volume meet
Sappho and two unfortunate Greeks. An account
is given in chapter three of the love
of Sappho and Phaon, and the hymn to
Aphrodite, quoted in the notes in Boileau’s
translation, is addressed to Phaon: “C’est pour
cet ingrat qu’un jour dans l’enthousiasme de
la poésie et de l’amour, je composai cette
ode qui a circulé dans toute la Grèce, et que
sans doute la postérité répétera encore.” In
the fourth chapter Antenor and his friend
attend the funeral of Sappho and see the ashes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
deposited in an urn. On the cippus is carved
a lyre with this epitaph:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Ci-gît Sapho, la gloire de nos jours;</div>
<div class="verse">Muses, pleurez, pleurez, Amours.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the seventh chapter an account is given of
Sappho’s last days, and Theagenes is revealed
as her rival, to whom Phaon has united himself
by a solemn bond. To Sappho is attributed a
long ode in which she invokes Venus and all the
infernal deities against her lover. She ends,
however, by returning to the sweetness and
generosity which had originally characterized
her. I quote only the last two stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Et toi, mes amours, ô ma lyre,</div>
<div class="verse">Douce compagne de mes jeux,</div>
<div class="verse">Repose toi, ma muse expire;</div>
<div class="verse">Reçois ici mes longs adieux.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Mourons; allons au noir rivage:</div>
<div class="verse">Heureuse, si, dans mon ennui,</div>
<div class="verse">De Phaon emportant l’image,</div>
<div class="verse">Je peux aux morts parler de lui.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The author evidently was fond of Sappho and
would compare with her Louise Labbé, <cite>la belle
Cordière</cite> (1526-1566), a woman of tender heart
and with a taste for passion, who wrote verses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
on love in Greek, Latin, Italian, French, and
Spanish. At this time Sappho was held in high
esteem and it was a compliment to call a writer
“a modern Sappho.” So for example in the
preface to L’Abbé Le Roy, <cite>Le Paradis perdu</cite>,
poëme traduit de l’Anglais de Milton en vers
françois (Rouen, 1775) we read: “Aussi a-t-on
fait le plus favorable et le plus juste accueil à
la charmante esquisse du Paradis Terrestre, que
daigna nous donner une femme célébre, dont le
nom seul fait l’éloge, Mme du Boccage, cette
Sappho moderne, qui fait d’honneur a la France.”</p>

<p>In 1777<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Note_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> Sauvigny published his <cite>Poésies de
Sapho</cite>, composed of eighteen odes, four <i lang="fr">scolies
morales</i>, four epigrams, the epitaphs of Timas
and Pelagon, some fragments, a letter of Sappho
to Phaon, and a hymn to Venus. There are
many pretty uses of Sappho, though in no sense
can the poems be said to be those of Sappho.
The third ode is an echo of the fragment on
the Evening Star:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Belle étoile du soir, digne ornement des cieux,</div>
<div class="verse center">...</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Tu fais rentrer le paisible troupeau,</div>
<div class="verse">Qui du loup ravisseur craint la dent meurtrière;</div>
<div class="verse">La fille qui, joyeuse, a quitté le hameau,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Tu la ramènes à sa mère.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Ces timides amans que Vénus a touchés,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Qui brûlent d’être unis ensemble,</div>
<div class="verse">Et que l’éclat du jour avait tenus cachés,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">C’est ton retour qui les rassemble.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The fifth ode renders the fragment on virginity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">La Jeune Épousée.</div>
<div class="verse">Rose de la pudeur que l’amour a cueillie,</div>

<div class="verse indent2">La Virginité.</div>
<div class="verse">Ingrate, vous l’avez perdu;</div>
<div class="verse">Vous l’avez perdu pour la vie.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The sixth ode is simply Boileau’s translation of
the Aphrodite hymn. The thirteenth, addressed
to Atthis, combines two fragments:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">La lune au front d’argent et sa cour lumineuse</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Echappent à mes yeux;</div>
<div class="verse">D’un voile plus obscur la nuit silencieuse</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Enveloppe les cieux.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Heure que j’attendais, qui dut m’être si chère,</div>
<div class="verse">Tu t’es évanouie, et je suis seule, ô dieux!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The fifteenth ode is a dialogue between Alcaeus
and Sappho, and the note interprets as Sappho’s
refusal of Alcaeus the famous fragment of which
a Latin version is given:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent1">Si nobis amicus es, torum accipe junior;</div>
<div class="verse">Non enim sustinebo consvescere cum seniore,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Dum junior sim.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other writers of the end of the eighteenth
century who paid tribute to Sappho were Bernis
in his ode <cite>Harmonie</cite>, Lebrun in his epigrams,
Parny in his <cite>Journée champêtre</cite>, La Harpe, who
knew only ode II, and M. Legouvé who writes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Vois Sapho; par Phaon trahie</div>
<div class="verse">Elle rendit son art confident de ses pleurs</div>
<div class="verse">Et merita la gloire en chantant ses malheurs.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Other French translators of about this time are
Regnier Desmarais, Ricard, Langeac, Deguerle,
Marchena, Blin de Sainmore, Abbé Batteux,
and Gorsse in <cite>Journal des Muses</cite> III.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century the echoes and translations
of Sappho are even more numerous. The
first of the neo-classicists, André Chénier, follower
of Boileau, owed much of his enthusiasm for the
Greeks to his Greek mother, and imitated Sappho
in the ode which he wrote for his love, the ode
so admired by Alfred de Musset, the charming
poet who also knew the sufferings of love:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Fanny, l’heureux mortel qui près de toi respire</div>
<div class="verse">Sait, à te voir parler, et rougir, et sourire</div>
<div class="verse">De quels hôtes divins le ciel est habité ...</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">He also used the fragment about Virginity
(Latouche edition I, p. 64). Jacques Delille,
the famous translator of Virgil, and the great
representative of didactic and descriptive
poetry, in his <cite>Poésies fugitives</cite> (1802) made a
good literal translation. In the same year
Vanderbourg published some verses camouflaged
as the <cite>Poésies</cite> de Madame Clotilde
de Surville, who was supposed to have lived
1405-1495. He gives a translation of the
famous second ode, of which I quote only the
last stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">S’ennuagent mes yeux: n’oy plus qu’ennuy, rumeurs,</div>
<div class="verse">Je brûle, je languis; chauds frissons dans ma veine</div>
<div class="verse">Circulent: je pâlis, je palpite, l’haleine</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Me manque, je me meurs.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The two great initiators of Romanticism also
knew Sappho. Madame de Staël wrote (1811) a
drama published 1821, <cite>Sapho</cite>, in which Phaon
is divided between love for two different women.
Chateaubriand in 1809 in <cite>Les Martyrs</cite><a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Note_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> makes
Cymodocée, who was on the point of becoming
a Christian and already betrothed to Eudore,
a fervent disciple of Christ, say to her fiancé:
“Dis-moi, puisqu’on peut aimer dans ton culte,
il y a donc une Vénus chrétienne?... Le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
colère de cette déesse est-elle redoutable? Force-t-elle
la jeune fille à chercher le jeune homme
dans la palestre, à l’introduire furtivement sous
le toit paternel? Ta Vénus rend-elle la langue
embarrassée? Répand-elle un feu brûlant, un
froid mortel dans les veines?” Chateaubriand
adds here (and also in <cite>Revolutions Anciennes</cite>)
Boileau’s translation and in the same place he
cites the passage from Racine’s <cite>Phèdre</cite> which we
have quoted, <a href="#Page_163">p. 163</a>. In 1805 L. Gorsse published
<cite>Sapho, poëme en dix chants</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Note_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> He defends
Sappho’s character (eleven years before the
German Welcker) but believes that her love for
Phaon was “un fait incontestable, dont tous
les genres de littérature ont le droit, de s’emparer.”
He speaks of the Abbé Barthélemy, who
in <cite>Voyage d’Anacharsis</cite> paints “les transports
et l’ardeur de Sapho;” also of Lantier, <cite>Voyages
d’Anténor</cite>, who had placed Sappho in such a
bright light that he has brought out new beauties
in the subject, which had not been seen
previously. Both quote Boileau’s translation.
Gorsse also praises, as possessing a grace which
men can never attain, the fragments of poetry
which two ladies, Mesdames de Beaufort-d’Hautpoul
and Caroline Wougne, published under the
name of <i>Sapho</i>. On pages 181-187 (Vol. II) he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
quotes a romance by each, attributed to Sappho,
which deals with her love for Phaon. In
that of Caroline Wougne Sappho meets Phaon
on his return from Sicily during a stormy
night in a country house where he is asking
for hospitality. Gorsse has also consulted
Madame Pipelet de Salm, who presented Sappho
on the lyric stage with grace and dignity. He
himself unites the legends of her love with those
of her writings, and drawing also on Tibullus,
Propertius, Virgil, Lucretius, and especially
Ovid, makes Sappho speak as poetess and lover
fifty expanded elegies. There are five in each of
the ten cantos besides a prologue and epilogue.
In view of the fact that none of Sappho’s elegies
are extant, the reconstruction, though fanciful,
is extremely interesting. The first five songs
picture Sappho’s desire, contentment, happiness,
fear, and calmness. Phaon is jealous of Alcaeus
and proposes to leave Lesbus to dwell in the
Vale of Tempe, but Sappho asks Phaon to share
in her poems, which will immortalize their love,
and then reveals to him the origin of music. The
second five represent her suspicion, grief, torment,
and pursuit of Phaon to Sicily, her despair
and the Leucadian Leap, after she sees Phaon
making eyes at Telesilla. In the fifth elegy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the first canto is an adaptation of Sappho’s
second ode, in which the first verse addressed
to Phaon is taken without acknowledgment
from André Chénier’s <cite>Fanny</cite>. Phaon seems to
be the principal figure, and the legends about
him are tremendously expanded with the help
of many Greek myths. As in so many other
writers he becomes a great athlete and must
overcome his opponents in the stadium. The
Italian author of <cite>Avventure di Saffo</cite> had done
likewise and made Phaon win with the same
throw which Ulysses used in Homer. The <cite>Voyages
d’Anténor</cite> had made Phaon first appear to
Sappho after winning in the gymnasium. Likewise
Gorsse has Sappho see Phaon for the first
time in the stadium at Mytilene. There she
describes the impression Phaon made on her,
when he won the athletic prize. All these
writers forget, however, that women in Sappho’s
day were not allowed to witness the nude athletic
contests. Gorsse shows his wide acquaintance
with the ancient accounts of Sappho when
in the fourth elegy of the second canto he
mentions: “un foible enfant, Cléis, qui t’est
si chère!” With only a few errors he represents
all the many friends and pupils of Sappho,—to
whom he gives classical epithets,—as helping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Sappho to preserve Phaon’s love. He is as
keen as the modern critics when he says in a
note that Erinna cannot be the famous poet,
but he is wrong in picturing <i>Brune Andromède</i>
and <i>Blonde Gorgo</i> as friends or pupils rather
than rivals of Sappho.</p>

</div>

<p>The second elegy in the fourth canto has a
pretty imitation of the famous third fragment.
Sappho dissuades Phaon from his jealousy of
Alcaeus, which of course is not an ancient
legend, in the following words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Comme un léger brouillard fuit aux rayons du jour,</div>

<div class="verse">Quand l’éclat argenté du char qu’elle conduit</div>
<div class="verse">Annonce que des cieux elle ouvre la barrière?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the third elegy of the same canto is an elaboration
of the fragment on the power of love,
the bitter-sweet irresistible creature, and in the
first elegy of the fifth canto there is an echo
of the fragment about wealth without virtue.
In long notes on the second elegy of the fifth
book Gorsse cites de Sivry’s or Sauvigny’s verse
translations or paraphrases in French, and Latin
versions of a score of other fragments and of the
Pelagon and Timas epitaphs. In the first elegy
of the sixth canto the Sapphic symptoms of
love are used:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent1">Je sens mes cheveux se dresser,</div>
<div class="verse">Mon sang brûler d’une flamme rapide,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Ou dans mes veines se glacer.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The third elegy of the same canto is an adaptation
of the hymn to Aphrodite and in the notes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
are given Latin versions by Gorsse himself,
Elias Andreas, and Birkow.</p>

<p>Not many have written elegies on Sappho, but
Gorsse was followed in 1812 by Touzet, who
wrote <cite>Sapho, poëme élégiaque</cite>. It was in 1816
that Lamartine wrote his mediocre imitation of
Sappho’s great hymn, calling it <cite>L’élégie antique</cite>.
It is in the cold restored pseudo-classical style
of Casimir Delavigne:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Dieux, quels transports nouveaux! ô dieux, comment décrire</div>
<div class="verse">Tons les feux dont mon sein se remplit à la fois?</div>
<div class="verse">Ma langue se glaça, je demeurai sans voix,</div>
<div class="verse">Et ma tremblante main laissa tomber ma lyre.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here is Lamartine’s own comment: “Un soir,
en rentrant d’une de ces excursions, pendant
laquelle nous avions relu la strophe unique, mais
brûlante, de Sapho, sorte de Vénus de Milo,
pareille à ce débris découvert par M. de Marcellus,
qui contient plus de beauté dans un fragment
qu’il n’y en a dans tout un musée de
statues intactes, je m’enfermai, et j’écrivis le
commencement grec de cette élégie ou de cette
<em>héroïde</em>....” In one of his <cite>Nouvelles Méditations
poétiques</cite> (not printed till 1823) he describes the
suffering of the abandoned Sappho and her last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
farewell words to the world and to life, before
her suicide; the last line is: “adieu chère Lesbos
à Vénus consacrée.” Lamartine was followed
in his idea of Sappho by Verlaine (1844-1896),
the prince of the French poets after the
death of Leconte de Lisle. Verlaine speaks of
Sappho as “furieuse, les yeux caves et les seins
roides.” In writing to his friend Virieu, April 8,
1819, Lamartine mentions the fact that he has
planned an opera on Jephté and adds that he
is thinking of writing one on Sappho, which,
however, was never written: “J’en ai un qui
me brûle, c’est une Sapho, superbe sujet d’un
opéra pareil.”</p>

<p>In 1815 came <cite>Sapho</cite>, poème en trois chants
par C. T. In 1820 Lazare Carnot published an
excellent verse translation of the second ode,
<cite>Les Symptomes d’Amour</cite>, and in 1827 E. Veïssier-Descombes,
a translator also of Anacreon, published
his classic rendering. In 1828 followed
the poetical version of Cousin and Girodet; in
1835, Breghot du Lut., in prose and poetry; in
1836 Alexandre Hope’s <cite>Sapho</cite>, a poem of about
ten pages; in 1843, prose renderings in Michaud’s
<cite>Biographie Universelle</cite>; in 1847, Marullot
et Grosset, in verse. In 1842, in the
<cite>Cariatides</cite>, Théodore de Banville, one of the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of the Romantic poets, that Greek “clown” of
France, wrote these verses on Sappho:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Et toi, grande Sappho, reine de Mitylène!</div>
<div class="verse">Lionne que l’Amour furieux enchaîna.</div>
<div class="verse">Près de la mer grondante, avec son Erinna,</div>
<div class="verse">Elle enseignait le rhythme et ses délicatesses</div>
<div class="verse">Au troupeau triomphal des jeunes poétesses,</div>
<div class="verse">Et glacée et brûlante, au bruit amer des flots</div>
<div class="verse">Elle mêlait ses cris de rage et ses sanglots.</div>
<div class="verse">O toi qui nous atteins avec des flèches sûres,</div>
<div class="verse">De quels feux tu brûlas et de quelles blessures</div>
<div class="verse">Son chaste sein meurtri par le baiser du vent!</div>
<div class="verse">Mais comme rien ne meurt de ce qui fut vivant,</div>
<div class="verse">Sa colère amoureuse et de souffrance avide,</div>
<div class="verse">Plus tard devait dicter sa plainte au fier Ovide,</div>
<div class="verse">Qui, choisissant l’amour, eût la meilleure part,</div>
<div class="verse">Et frémir dans les vers d’Horace et de Ronsard.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Baudelaire (1821-1867), the morbid realist,
uses the story of the Leucadian Leap in his
<cite>Lesbos</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">—L’oeil d’azur est vaincu par l’oeil noir que tachète</div>
<div class="verse">Le cercle ténébreux tracé par les douleurs</div>
<div class="verse">De la mâle Sapho, l’amante et le poète!</div>
<div class="verse">Plus belle que Vénus se dressant sur le monde.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In a literary fragment (1845), entitled <cite>Sapho</cite>,
he refers to a famous and remarkable tragedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
on Sappho which was to be published soon
afterwards by Arsène Houssaye. He quotes
some verses which are reminiscent of Sappho’s
second ode:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Oui, Phaon, je vous aime; et, lorsque je vous vois,</div>
<div class="verse">Je perds le sentiment et la force et la voix.</div>
<div class="verse">Je souffre tout le jour le mal de votre absence,</div>
<div class="verse">Mai qui n’égale pas l’heur de votre présence;</div>
<div class="verse">Si bien que vous trouvant, quand vous venez le soir,</div>
<div class="verse">La cause de ma joie et de mon désespoir,</div>
<div class="verse">Mon âme les compense, et sous les lauriers roses</div>
<div class="verse">Etouffe l’ellébore et les soucis moroses.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1873 we have a translation by Etienne
Prosper Dubois-Gucham, <cite>La Grecque Pléiade</cite>;
in 1878 that of P. L. Courier; in 1882, the verses
of de la Roche. About this time J. Richepin
published in his undated romance, <cite>Grandes
Amoureuses</cite>, prose translations of several fragments,
and in 1889 Paul Lenois made a prose
version. In 1884, Alphonse Daudet, after
writing a novel on French life and customs
as a warning to young men, and picturing
a courtesan carried upstairs in the arms
of her lover, gave the courtesan and the
novel the title of <cite>Sapho</cite>. Soon afterwards
appeared anonymously Madame E. Caro’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
<cite>Sapho</cite>. In 1895 were heard the songs of Pierre
Louys, who in <cite>Les chansons de Bilitis traduites
du Grec pour la première fois</cite><a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Note_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> transforms
Mytilene into a modern Sodom and Sappho into
the mistress of a band of <i>hetaerae</i>. He pretends
that he is translating Greek poems that were
found in excavating the poetess’ grave on
Amathus. He even represents them as published
by a Doctor Heim of Leipzig. Further to
mystify the reader Louys tells of some of the
poems that have not been translated and marks
restorations in the text, as if these songs had
actually been found marred and mutilated and
as if the archaeologist had restored the missing
words. He even uses, to give a Greek atmosphere,
many Greek expressions such as <i>Kypris
Philommeïdès</i>. Many of his Greek forms, such
as Dzeus, are absurd. Charming as are these
<cite>Bucoliques en Pamphylie</cite>, <cite>Élégies à Mitylène</cite>,
<cite>Épigrammes dans l’île de Chypre</cite>, they belong
rather to pornographic literature, as does his
romance called <cite>Aphrodite</cite>, in which the pseudo-Lesbian
idea of two girls marrying one another
is to be found. Such bits of perverted Sapphism
as appear in many other French writers
have no place in the literature of the real Sappho,
who can now, after the discovery of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the new papyri, easily be distinguished from
the Sappho of romance and legend. Unfortunately
the last French translation by Meunier
(1911) does not include these recent relics.</p>

<p>One of the latest French imitations of
Sappho is by that great reviver of Aristophanes,
Maurice Donnay, whose comedies have attracted
such large audiences in Europe. In his
<cite>Lysistrata</cite> (Act I, scene II), Donnay makes the
pretty Hirondelle as she walks along the shore
of the violet sea recite to the accompaniment
of the music of the waves the song which divine
Sappho composed for the Egyptian courtesan
Rhodopis, although we have no evidence for
such a song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Rhodopis, ton amant est comme</div>
<div class="verse">Un dieu: son bonheur me courrouce.</div>
<div class="verse">Quand je pense que c’est un homme</div>
<div class="verse">Pour qui ta voix se fait si douce,</div>
<div class="verse">Et que c’est Charaxos, mon frère,</div>
<div class="verse">Qui possède ta chair superbe,</div>
<div class="verse">Et ta Beauté dont j’étais fière,</div>
<div class="verse">Je deviens plus verte que l’herbe.</div>
<div class="verse">Mes yeux se troublent, mes oreilles</div>
<div class="verse">S’emplissent de murmures vagues</div>
<div class="verse">Et de grandes rumeurs pareilles</div>
<div class="verse">Au bruit que fait le choc des vagues.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Et voilà qu’une sueur froide</div>
<div class="verse">Inonde tout mon corps qui tremble,</div>
<div class="verse">Puis, je reste sans souffle, et froide</div>
<div class="verse">Ainsi qu’un cadavre, il me semble</div>
<div class="verse">Que je meurs! que je meurs!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This, of course, is an echo of the famous second
ode of Sappho which has influenced all ages and
countries and continues so to do. Hardly a
year passes without some translation or reminiscence
of it in Greece or Italy, in France or
Germany, in England or America.</p>

<h2 id="XI_SAPPHO_IN_ENGLISH_AND_AMERICAN_LITERATURE">XI. SAPPHO IN ENGLISH AND AMERICAN LITERATURE</h2>

<p>Sappho was little read in England and as
a writer of poetry probably did not exist,
except for a few Englishmen of great
learning, before the sixteenth century. Even in
the seventeenth century Thomas Stanley, a man
of considerable culture, omitted Sappho from his
translation of Anacreon (1650). In the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries the imitations
limit themselves to the Sapphic metre,<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Note_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> with
the exception of the famous line in Ben Jonson’s
pastoral drama, <cite>The Sad Shepherd</cite> (Act II,
2): “But best the dear good angel of the spring,
The nightingale,” and of Sir Philip Sidney, who
seems to have been entirely forgotten by modern
writers on Sappho. But it is interesting to
note, in the movement led by Gabriel Harvey
in pre-Shakesperian days to write English poetry
in classical metres, that sapphics were attempted
by Harvey’s friend, Sir Philip Sidney, in <cite>The
Countesse of Pembroke’s Arcadia</cite>, which was
begun in 1580. One stanza will suffice to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
how strained were the strophes thus manufactured:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">If mine eyes can speak to do hearty errand,</div>
<div class="verse">Or mine eyes’ language she do hap to judge of,</div>
<div class="verse">So that eyes’ message be of her received,</div>
<div class="verse">Hope we do live yet.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is rather strange that Sir Philip did not use
this metre in his translation of the second ode
of Sappho, but employed anacreontics.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">My Muse, what ailes this ardor?</div>
<div class="verse">Mine eyes be dim, my limbs shake,</div>
<div class="verse">My voice is hoarse, my throat scorch’d,</div>
<div class="verse">My tongue to this my roof cleaves,</div>
<div class="verse">My fancy amaz’d, my thoughts dull’d,</div>
<div class="verse">My heart doth ake, my life faints,</div>
<div class="verse">My soul begins to take leave.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This being a wholly iambic measure does not
appear so exotic as the sapphics. Indeed, the
youthful experimenter achieved a noteworthy
success in rhythmic effect by ending each line
with a foot composed of one strong syllable.</p>

<p>Most of the knowledge there was of Sappho
in the Elizabethan and Jacobean times, however,
seems to have been superficially based
mainly on the Ovidian legend. Such a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
story told by such a wonderful story-teller
interested the early classicists in England, and
the Phaon myth permeated much literature.</p>

<p>Ben Jonson (<cite>Under-Woods</cite>, No. 45) says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Did Sappho, on her seven-tongu’d lute,</div>
<div class="verse">So speak (as yet it is not mute)</div>
<div class="verse">Of Phaon’s form?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thomas Nashe in his novel, <cite>The Unfortunate
Traveller</cite> (1594), is a typical example: “Golde
easily bends, the most ingenious minds are
easiest moved, <i lang="la">Ingenium nobis molle Thalia
dedit</i>, said <i>Psapho</i> to <i>Phao</i>.” It is just possible
that Robert Herrick (1591-1674), who published
so many poems to or upon <i>Sapho</i>, the name of
his own love, knew from Athenaeus the fragment
(E. 62) “much whiter than an egg,”
when he published in <cite>Hesperides</cite>, No. 350
(1648) the verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Fain would I kiss my Julia’s dainty leg,</div>
<div class="verse">Which is as white and hair-less as an egge.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">John Lyly made Sappho an allegorical image
of the Virgin Queen: “I will ever be virgin,”
says Sappho. The play, <cite>Sapho and Phao</cite>, was
produced in 1584 in the presence of Queen
Elizabeth. Lyly makes Sappho a princess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Syracuse and takes many liberties with the
historical Sappho. Lyly’s Sappho resembles the
Queen, and Phao is supposed to be the Duke of
Leicester, but in such an allegory all reference
to the Leucadian Leap has to be omitted, and
there are no echoes of Sappho’s own fragments.
When Phaon comes, Sappho soliloquizes: “Wilt
thou open thy love? Yea? No, Sapho, but
staring in his face till thine eyes dazzle and thy
spirits faint, die before his face; then this shall
be written on thy tomb, that though thy love
were greater than wisdom could endure, yet
thine honour was such as love could not violate.”
Aphrodite interrupts their love and
Phaon says: “This shall be my resolution, where-ever
I wander, to be as I were kneeling before
Sapho; my loyalty unspotted, though unrewarded....
My life shall be spent in sighing
and wishing, the one for my bad fortune, the
other for Sapho’s good.” Even Robert Burton
in that famous storehouse of quotations, his
<cite>Anatomy of Melancholy</cite> (1621), does not know
Sappho as a poetess, and refers only to the
<cite>Leucata Petra</cite>: “Here leaped down that Lesbian
Sappho for Phaon on whom she miserably doted,
hoping thus to ease herself and to be freed of
her love pangs.” The first English translation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of Sappho’s second ode (1652), quoted by Edwin
Cox, is John Hall’s version in his translation
of the <cite>Treatise an the Sublime</cite>. He does not
mention Sidney, and Addison did not know even
Hall’s translation or that of Pulteney, for he
says that the versions by Ambrose Philips in
1711 were the first. In 1675 Edward Phillips
in his <cite>Theatrum Poetarum</cite> devoted a chapter to
Ancient Poetesses and Sappho. He knew the
tradition of a second Sappho, but quoted no
fragments. In 1680 Pulteney, who had a knowledge
of small Latin and less Greek, gave a
filtered translation from the French of the
<cite>Treatise on the Sublime</cite> and the second Sapphic
ode. In 1695 appeared another translation by
an unknown author, but it was not till 1711 that
any detailed study of Sappho began. In that
year, in the Spectator (nos. 223, 229, and 233),
Joseph Addison discussed Sappho at length.
Even then we have only the namby-pamby
verses of Ambrose Philips, so overpraised by
Addison. Soon followed translations by Herbert
in 1713, in his edition of Petronius (pp. 325-328);
and in 1719, by Green. In 1735 John Addison
published the works of Anacreon with Sappho
added, in which the <cite>Loeb Classical Library</cite> idea
of putting the Greek text on one page and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
translation on the opposite page was anticipated.
Philips’ version of the Aphrodite hymn
was forty-two lines long, but Addison gives one
of his own in twenty-eight lines, which is the
number in the original Greek. His own rendering
is as good as that of Philips, which perhaps
is damning it with faint praise. His translations
of the eight fragments which he includes
are also not remarkable. In 1748, we have
Tobias Smollett’s version of the second ode in
<cite>Roderick Random</cite>. About 1745, Mark Akenside
in his tenth <cite>Ode on Lyric Poetry</cite> based a stanza
on Sappho’s first ode. In 1760, “a Gentleman
of Cambridge” published his verse translations.
In some publications he is considered
to be different from Francis Fawkes, who undoubtedly
is the gentleman referred to. In
1768 appeared E. B. Greene’s free and mediocre
translation, in which Aphrodite’s doves become
“feathered steeds,” and which ignores the Sapphic metre.
In 1796, Mrs. Mary Robinson published
<cite>Sappho and Phaon</cite>, but these sonnets of
hers are not, as she claims, legitimate descendants
of the real Sappho.</p>

<p>It was not till the nineteenth century, however,
that the actual literary remains of Sappho
were scientifically studied. In 1814, we have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
translations of Elton, in 1815 of Egerton, in
1833 the Sapphics by Merivale, in 1854
Palgrave, in 1877 Walhouse. In 1869, Edwin
Arnold’s <cite>Poets of Greece</cite> gave one of the
best renderings of the Aphrodite hymn in Sapphic
metre and included pretty translations of
nine of her fragments. Edwin Arnold called
her: “that exquisite poetess ... whose genius
among all feminine votaries of singing stands
incontestably highest.” He protests against
Swinburne’s repetition of the scandal against
her sweet name which gossiping generations
have invented; he rejects the Leucadian Leap
and the Phaon myth. In 1871 T. W. Higginson
wrote his important article on Sappho for <cite>The
Atlantic Monthly</cite>, which can now be found in
his <cite>Atlantic Essays</cite>. He translated several of
the fragments and the hymn than which, he
says, “there is not a lyrical poem in Greek
literature nor in any other which has by its
artistic structure inspired more enthusiasm.”
He subjects to many a hard blow that paltry
Scot soul, Colonel Mure, whose history of Greek
literature ought to be tabooed. He repudiates
the calumnies of the comedians and scandal-mongers.
His appreciation of Sappho is one of
the best that has been written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1883 J. A. Symonds published his translations,
and some of them were made for and included
in that charming little book of Wharton’s,
which appeared in its first edition in 1885. Even
before Wharton, Swinburne had given his high
estimate of Sappho and had melted together
many of the fragments into his <cite>Anactoria</cite>. In
1894, Maurice Thompson published in <cite>The
Atlantic Monthly</cite>, “The Sapphic Secret,” and
gave a fine appreciation of Sappho with translations
of the shorter fragments. During the
last thirty years the discovery of new papyri
has stimulated interest in Sappho and many
books and articles, scientific and popular, have
been printed. For a discussion of the recovery
of Greek literature from papyri and the difficulties
involved in deciphering and restoring
Sappho’s new fragments, I refer the reader to
my introduction on the subject in Miller-Robinson,
<cite>The Songs of Sappho</cite>. I refer the
reader to the <a href="#BIBLIOGRAPHY">bibliography</a> for some of the books
and to a note<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178b"></a><a href="#Note_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> for references to some popular
articles, and call special attention to the volumes
of Easby-Smith, Miss Patrick, Petersen, Edmonds,
Cox, Tucker, and Edward Storer, most of
whom give their own verse renderings of some,
if not all, of Sappho’s fragments. Many modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
poets, both British and American, have
adapted or expanded Sappho’s fragments in
English verse, Lucy Milburn, Bliss Carman,
Percy Osborn, that pure Pelasgian, John Myers
O’Hara. Recently Dr. Marion Mills Miller,
formerly of Princeton University, has published
metrical adaptations of all the old and new
fragments, which are graceful and witty. He
has also given the romance of Sappho’s life in
verse and has made a new poetical translation
of Ovid’s <cite>Sappho to Phaon</cite>. In the same volume
(<a href="#BIBLIOGRAPHY">cf. Bibliography</a>), I have published the Greek
text of all Sappho with a literal translation and
two introductions. One deals with the recovery
and restoration of Sappho’s relics and shows
the romance as well as the difficulties involved
in deciphering and restoring her poems. The
other discusses Sappho’s life and works.</p>

<p>The influence of Sappho on English and
American literature has been large. We have
already shown this in our citations, as it seemed
better to quote some of the great English writers
when we were speaking of Sappho herself. Addison
was devoted to her, but his contemporary,
Pope, by translating Ovid’s <cite>Sappho to Phaon</cite>,
aggravated the ill-fame which Ovid had given
her. Pope often mentions her, but without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
knowledge of the true Sappho. In <cite>Moral Essays</cite>
(<cite>Epistle</cite> III, 121) we have the line: “Why she
(Phryne) and Sappho raise that monstrous
sum?”, referring to Lady Montague and to
Miss Skerrett, the latter of whom was the mistress
and later the second wife of Sir Robert
Walpole. Lady Mary (Montague) is alluded
to also in <cite>Epistle</cite> II, 24:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">As Sappho’s diamonds with her dirty smock;</div>
<div class="verse">Or Sappho at her toilet’s greasy task,</div>
<div class="verse">With Sappho fragrant at an evening mask.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Also in the <cite>Prologue to the Satires</cite>, in the
<cite>Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot</cite>, 369, we read: “Sappho
can tell you how this man was bit.” Sappho
is mentioned again in <cite>Imitations of Horace</cite> (<cite>Satire</cite>
I, l. 83) and in <cite>Satires of Dr. John Donne</cite>
(II, 6), in these words: “As who knows Sappho,
smiles at other whores.” In his letters to Cromwell,
Pope often mentions two Sapphos, one his
own and the other Cromwell’s: “My service,
pray, to the other Sappho, who it is to be hoped,
has not yet cast herself headlong from any of
the Leucades about London, although her Phaon
lately fled from her into Lincolnshire.” Even
in the letter to Steele, when he makes acknowledgment
to the “fine fragment of Sappho,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Pope is disingenuous and affected, as he suppresses
the name of Flatman, to whom he was
really indebted.</p>

<p>Wordsworth, influenced probably by Welcker’s
defense, had a good opinion of Sappho
(<a href="#Page_247">cf. the quotation, p. 247</a>). But his dear friend,
Sir Walter Scott, seems to be ignorant of her,
though the lines on the <cite>Evening Star</cite>, which we
have quoted (<a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>), sound strikingly Sapphic.
Coleridge seems to echo the famous fragment
about the pippin on the topmost bough in his
<cite>One Red Leaf on the Topmost Twig</cite>; but as
he shows no other influence of Sappho this is
probably an accidental resemblance. Thomas
Moore, as a translator of Anacreon with whom
Sappho was generally linked, knew Sappho well
and translated some of her fragments into Latin
as well as English. His rendering of the <cite>Weaving
Song</cite> is especially charming (<a href="#Page_79">cf. p. 79</a>).
Another contemporary Irish poet, the Reverend
George Croly, tells how:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Passion gave the living breath</div>
<div class="verse">That shook the chords of Sappho’s lyre.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of the post-Revolution poets the bombastic
Byron, who may have learned something about
Sappho from his friend and editor, Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Moore, refers to her most. In <cite>Don Juan</cite> (III,
107), he expands, none too well, into a stanza of
eight the two lines in which Sappho has painted
such a beautiful miniature landscape of reunited
village life. As Livingstone says in
<cite>The Legacy of Greece</cite> (p. 265): “the English
genius is rich and lavish rather than restrained.
It is less in its nature to write like Sappho.”
Was Livingstone not thinking also of Swinburne
and many another modern poet who plays so
many indistinct, un-Greek variations on that
divine line: “I loved thee once, Atthis, in the
long ago,” which Mackail has called “just one
sliding sigh and whisper of sound.” There is another
expansion by the poet laureate of Canada,
which we have quoted in a note (<a href="#Page_257">p. 257</a>).
It is Byron who in <cite>Don Juan</cite> (III, 76) speaks of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece!</div>
<div class="verse">Where burning Sappho loved and sung;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and in <cite>Don Juan</cite> (II) he speaks of “Sappho,
the sage bluestocking in whose grave All those
may leap who rather would be neuter.” In the
controversy between Byron and Boules with
regard to the second ode, Byron says: “Is not
this sublime and fierce love for one of her own
sex? And is not Philips’ translation of it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the mouths of all your women? And are the
English schools or the English women the more
corrupt for all this?” Byron echoes the element
of fire which has so often been noted in Sappho’s
songs, by critics from Plutarch to Sara Teasdale.
He knows the story derived from Ovid
and Maximus of Tyre that she was dark (<a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>)
and also the legend of the Lover’s Leap (<cite>Childe
Harold</cite>, II, 39-41):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Childe Harold sail’d, and pass’d the barren spot,</div>
<div class="verse">Where sad Penelope o’erlook’d the wave;</div>
<div class="verse">And onward view’d the mount, not yet forgot,</div>
<div class="verse">The lover’s refuge, and the Lesbian’s grave.</div>
<div class="verse">Dark Sappho! could not verse immortal save</div>
<div class="verse">That breast imbued with such immortal fire?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Childe Harold hail’d Leucadia’s cape afar;</div>
<div class="verse center">...</div>
<div class="verse">But when he saw the evening star above</div>
<div class="verse">Leucadia’s far-projecting rock of woe,</div>
<div class="verse">And hail’d the last resort of fruitless love,</div>
<div class="verse">He felt, or deem’d he felt, no common glow.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>While Shelley and Keats do not have clear
echoes of Sappho, they come nearer to her in
spirit than any other modern poets; but, even
so, Keats’ sensuousness removes him from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Sappho. W. L. Courtney, in a very interesting
article on <cite>Sappho and Aspasia</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178c"></a><a href="#Note_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> says: “Shelley
has the true lyrical note, and Keats some of
that chiselled loveliness which makes each Sapphic
stanza a masterpiece.” One might even
suspect that Shelley knew the second ode, at
least in some secondary source, when he composed
<cite>To Constantia Singing</cite>.</p>

<p>Women poets naturally have taken an interest
in Sappho. Mrs. Hemans, the English lyrist
(1793-1835), speaks of “Sappho’s fervent heart.”
Elizabeth Barrett Browning seems to have
known only the song of the rose to which we
have referred above (<a href="#Page_68">p. 68</a>). She is familiar
with the Lover’s Leap legend, as was Byron,
for she speaks in <cite>A Vision of Poets</cite> of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">—Sappho, with that gloriole</div>
<div class="verse">Of ebon hair on calmèd brows—</div>
<div class="verse">O poet-woman! none foregoes</div>
<div class="verse">The leap, attaining the repose.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Matthew Arnold there is much classical
influence, but <cite>A Modern Sappho</cite> has nothing of
ancient Sappho. Walter Savage Landor,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Note_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> who
looked back to Greece from Rome and by his
delightful dialogues made the ancient ages live
again, is one of the few who decry Sappho. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
seems to be jealous when he says that “Sappho
is not the only poetess who has poured forth
her melodies to Hesperus, or who had reason to
thank him.” He composes ten verses himself
entitled <cite>Sappho to Hesperus</cite>, which are not like
Sappho’s at all. Likewise he takes eight lines
to express the thought of the despair of the
love-sick maiden over her faithless lover, which
Sappho depicts in a better picture of a single
couplet. Landor finds Sappho deficient in delicacy
in her answer to Alcaeus and attributes
to her an epigram about Alcaeus which she
never wrote. He would obliterate no letter of
the invocation to Hesperus by a tear of his.
Among the poems of Sappho he finds one written
in a different hand from the rest, which pleases
him as much as any of them, but it reads like
Landor and is inferior to what Sappho would
have said. In <cite>Simonidea</cite> he tries his hand at
the <cite>Weaving Song</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Mother I cannot mind my wheel</div>
<div class="verse">My fingers ache, my lips are dry,</div>
<div class="verse">Oh if you felt the pain I feel!</div>
<div class="verse">But oh, who ever felt as I?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Charles Kingsley wrote a beautiful poem on
Sappho, which well represents her mood; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
there is hardly even a faint echo of Sappho’s
own fragments unless the words “all her veins
ran fever” are accidentally suggested by the
second ode.</p>

<p>William Cory, famous translator of the
Heraclitus epigram, who published poems on
Stesichorus and other classical subjects, prettily
transformed one of the fragments into:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Woman dead, lie there;</div>
<div class="verse">No record of thee</div>
<div class="verse">Shall there ever be,</div>
<div class="verse">Since thou dost not share</div>
<div class="verse">Roses in Pieria grown.</div>
<div class="verse">In the deathful cave,</div>
<div class="verse">With the feeble troop</div>
<div class="verse">Of the folk that droop,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Lurk and flit and crave,</div>
<div class="verse">Woman severed and far-flown.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">William Morris, a fine classical scholar, as shown
in his <cite>Life and Death of Jason</cite>, in <cite>The Earthly
Paradise</cite> (1868-1871), expands in a very readable
form the story of the Egyptian courtesan, Rhodopis,
whom Sappho’s brother, Charaxus, ransomed.
About the same time (1870) Rossetti
made the combination of two fragments which
we have mentioned above (<a href="#Page_93">p. 93</a>). Some tell
us that Oscar Wilde’s heart goes out to Sappho,
but so far as I have read I have not been able
to find in him any trace of the real Sappho.<a name="FNanchor_178a" id="FNanchor_178a"></a><a href="#Note_178a" class="fnanchor">178a</a>
On the other hand, Tennyson and Swinburne
read her fragments over and over. Tennyson,
who thought the Sapphics of Horace to be
“much inferior to those of Sappho,” beautifully
paraphrases the second ode in <cite>Eleänore</cite> (1832).
In the original edition of <cite>Fatima</cite> (Dec. 1832),
published under the title <cite>O Love, Love, Love</cite>, he
prefixed the first line of this ode as a motto.
Many as are the echoes of the sweet-bitter,
bitter-sweet antithesis of Sappho (E. 81, <a href="#Page_57">above,
p. 57</a>) in Wharton and other critics, it seems
strange that perhaps the most beautiful and
deep-hearted of all, Elaine’s song in Tennyson’s
Idyl is never cited, so far as I know.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Note_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Love, art thou sweet? then bitter death must be:</div>
<div class="verse">Love, thou art bitter; sweet is death to me.</div>
<div class="verse">O Love, if death be sweeter, let me die.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Tennyson echoes the third fragment, as we have
seen (<a href="#Page_63">p. 63</a>); and he re-echoes through Horace
another fragment in his <cite>Epilogue</cite> (<a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>). In
<cite>Fatima</cite>, “Love, O withering might” suggests
another fragment. In <cite>Leonine Elegiacs</cite> we have
a better adaptation than in Byron of the
Hesperus hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The ancient poetess singeth, that Hesperus all things bringeth,</div>
<div class="verse">Smoothing the wearied mind: bring me my love, Rosalind.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In <cite>Locksley Hall Sixty Years After</cite> he again uses
the same Sapphic fragment: “Hesper, whom the
poet call’d the Bringer home of all good things.”
His brother, Frederick Tennyson, who was such
a good Greek scholar that he won the medal at
Trinity College for a Greek poem, in his <cite>Isles of
Greece</cite> (1890) used several adaptations and translations
of Sappho, the prettiest being those
about Sappho’s child Cleïs, about Hesper and
the summer noonday siesta by the cool waters.
Many writers of lyrics in England and Scotland
have thought of Sappho, but generally of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the Phaon story, as recently did Thomas McKie
in his <cite>Lyric on Love</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Note_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Bewildered with her love and grief,</div>
<div class="verse">From lone Leucadia’s stormy steep</div>
<div class="verse">Distracted Sappho sought relief,</div>

<div class="verse">The deep that closed upon her woes</div>
<div class="verse">Not half so wild, impetuous flows.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Swinburne is one of Sappho’s greatest admirers,
and we have quoted some of his praises
among the appreciations of Sappho (<a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>).
We have cited Noyes’ appreciation of
Swinburne’s love of Sappho, and here are
Thomas Hardy’s interesting lines to Swinburne:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">—His singing-mistress verily was no other</div>
<div class="verse">Than she the Lesbian, she the music-mother</div>

<div class="verse">Into the rambling world-encircling deep</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Which hides her where none sees.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And one can hold in thought that nightly here</div>
<div class="verse">His phantom may draw down to the water’s brim,</div>
<div class="verse">And hers come up to meet it, as a dim</div>
<div class="verse">Lone shine upon the heaving hydrosphere,</div>
<div class="verse">And mariners wonder as they traverse near,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Unknowing of her and him.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">One dreams him sighing to her spectral form:</div>
<div class="verse">“O teacher, where lies hid thy burning line;</div>
<div class="verse">Where are those songs, O poetess divine</div>
<div class="verse">Whose very arts are love incarnadine?”</div>
<div class="verse">And her smile back: “Disciple true and warm,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Sufficient now are thine.” ...</div>
</div>
<div class="attr">(<span class="smcap">Thomas Hardy</span>, <cite>A Singer Asleep</cite>)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>While perhaps Swinburne exaggerates in his
praise of Sappho, he owes much to the great
poetess of love:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Love’s priestess, mad with pain and joy of song,</div>
<div class="verse">Song’s priestess, mad with joy and pain of love.</div>
<div class="attr">(<cite>On the Cliffs</cite>)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He makes her say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">My blood was hot wan wine of love,</div>
<div class="verse">And my song’s sound the sound thereof,</div>
<div class="verse">The sound of the delight of it.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In <cite>Tristram of Lyonesse</cite> he speaks of “Sweet
Love, that art so bitter,” and in <cite>Anactoria</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">My life is bitter with thy love; thine eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Blind me, thy tresses burn me ...</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">His poems have many Sapphic echoes. In his
youth he poured several of Sappho’s fragments
into the melting pot of <cite>Anactoria</cite>, where she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
a nerve-racked woman, torn by passion, sensuous
and lascivious, altogether too “Sapphic.”
The rhetoric in his lines is gorgeous, but he loses
much of Sappho’s emotional power. “That one
low, pellucid phrase,” as Mackail calls the line,
“I say that one will think of us even hereafter,”
is expanded into:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Yea, thou shalt be forgotten like spilt wine</div>
<div class="verse">Except these kisses of my lips on thine</div>
<div class="verse">Brand them with immortality; but me—</div>
<div class="verse">Men shall not see bright fire nor hear the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor mix their hearts with music, nor behold</div>
<div class="verse">Cast forth of heaven with feet of awful gold</div>
<div class="verse">And plumeless wings that make the bright air blind,</div>
<div class="verse">Lightning, with thunder for a hound behind</div>
<div class="verse">Hunting through fields unfurrowed and unsown—</div>
<div class="verse">But in the light and laughter, in the moan</div>
<div class="verse">And music, and in grasp of lip and hand</div>
<div class="verse">And shudder of water that makes felt on land</div>
<div class="verse">The immeasurable tremor of all the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">Memories shall mix and metaphors of me.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The famous fragment of four lines which we
have quoted above (<a href="#Page_69">p. 69</a>) becomes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Thee too the years shall cover; thou shalt be</div>
<div class="verse">As the rose born of one same blood with thee,</div>
<div class="verse">As a song sung, as a word said, and fall</div>
<div class="verse">Flower-wise, and be not any more at all,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Nor any memory of thee anywhere;</div>
<div class="verse">For never Muse has bound above thine hair</div>
<div class="verse">The high Pierian flower whose graft outgrows</div>
<div class="verse">All Summer kinship of the mortal rose</div>
<div class="verse">And colour of deciduous days, nor shed</div>
<div class="verse">Reflex and flush of heaven above thine head, etc.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Aphrodite hymn which he paraphrased in
<cite>Anactoria</cite> is used again in <cite>Songs of the Spring-tides</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">O thou of divers-coloured mind, O thou</div>
<div class="verse">Deathless, God’s daughter subtle-souled</div>
<div class="verse center">...</div>
<div class="verse">Child of God, close craftswoman, I beseech thee;</div>
<div class="verse">Bid not ache nor agony break nor master,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Lady, my spirit.</div>
<div class="attr">(<cite>On the Cliffs</cite>)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the same poem the mature Swinburne comes
closer than in his youth to Sappho, when he
says: “The tawny sweet-winged thing, Whose
cry was but of spring.” But even in this poem
he dilutes Sappho’s one line into six or more:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘I loved thee’—hark, one tenderer note than all—</div>
<div class="verse">‘Atthis, of old time once’—one low long fall,</div>
<div class="verse">Sighing—one long low lovely loveless call,</div>
<div class="verse">Dying—one pause in song so flamelike fast—</div>
<div class="verse">‘Atthis, long since in old time overpast’—</div>
<div class="verse">One soft first pause and last.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">We cannot take leave of Swinburne without
paying tribute to his Sapphics. English and
American poets in general have not been successful
with the Sapphic strophe, though in
modern times Canning’s <cite>Needy Knife-grinder</cite> is
a good specimen; and Tennyson caught the
real Greek cadence in his specimen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Faded every violet, all the roses;</div>
<div class="verse">Gone the glorious promise, and the victim</div>
<div class="verse">Broken in this anger of Aphrodite</div>
<div class="verse">Yields to the victor.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Many have experimented with the Sapphic
stanza, as recently Clinton Scollard and Thomas
S. Jones, Jr., in their <cite>Sapphics</cite>.</p>

<p>Marion Mills Miller<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Note_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> has written some good
Sapphics, though his theory of the proper rendition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of Sapphic metre will cause some controversy
among scholars. We have not the space
here to discuss the history of the Sapphic metre,
which if not first used by Sappho was first perfected
by her. It has been employed extensively
in all ages. Horace has it some twenty-six times.
Elizabethan renderings can be found in Robinson
Ellis’ preface to his translation of Catullus.
By Rhabanus (766-856) it was fitted to hymns
such as those for the <cite>Feast of St. John the Baptist</cite>,
for Candlemas, Michaelmas, and for the Feast
of St. Benedict, and it was employed for his
hymns in the <cite>Common of Confessors</cite> and the
<cite>Common of Virgins</cite>. But no one else has ever
caught the Sapphic rhythm and melody so well
as Swinburne in his early poem called <cite>Sapphics</cite>:</p>

Monument of Phaon</cite>, a poem published in 1795,

<p>Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) in the index to
the first volume of the <cite>Southern Literary Messenger</cite>
states that a stanza of Sappho’s second
ode is embodied in his poem, <cite>To Sarah</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In such an hour when are forgot</div>

<div class="verse">If they should stray from thee.</div>

<div class="verse">Wings till they trailed in the dust,</div>

<div class="verse">Of her who lov’d a mortal—and so died.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Dr. Thomas O. Mabbott of Columbia University
has called my attention to the fact that Poe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
published a version of Sappho’s second ode by
Mary E. Hewitt in <cite>Broadway Journal</cite>, I, no. 24
(1845); that he knew “Udoch’s” note (<cite>Southern
Literary Messenger</cite>, I, p. 454, April, 1835) where
there is a reference to the <cite>Spectator</cite>, no. 229;
and that the paper, <cite>Some Ancient Greek Authors</cite>,
signed P. in the <cite>Southern Literary Messenger</cite>
for April, 1836, where a conventional account of
Sappho is given, was probably written by Poe.</p>

<p>Later American literature, like that of other
countries, is full of the name of Sappho, even
if it does not show a profound knowledge of
the fragments of the actual Sappho. In any
case, such dramas and poems and novels reveal
the tremendous potentiality of her name. We
have referred to translations or adaptations by
Easby-Smith, Lucy Milburn, J. M. O’Hara, Bliss
Carman, Petersen, Storer, and Marion Mills
Miller. There have been renderings of individual

American renderings of single songs or fragments,
although we have incidentally in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
book mentioned many such, and an abundance
of references will be found in the notes. Nor
can we give the titles of all the tragedies and
poems which have been inspired by the name
of Sappho. We select only a few of the more
important. There is an interesting tragedy in
five acts called <cite>Sappho of Lesbos</cite> by Mrs. Estelle
Lewis (“Stella”), whom Edgar Allan Poe called
“the rival of Sappho.” The play was put on
the stage in London in 1868 and afterwards
was given on the Athenian stage in a modern
Greek version. It reached a seventh edition.
It should be credited to America, since
Mrs. Lewis was Miss Anna Blanche Robinson,
born near Baltimore in 1824. She translated
Virgil’s <cite>Aeneid</cite> when a mere schoolgirl, and
afterwards married Mr. Lewis of Brooklyn,
New York. She travelled much abroad, but
returned to America, where she wrote some
of the plays before she went to live in London
in 1865. In 1876 was published Ellen Frothingham’s
translation of Grillparzer’s <cite>Sappho</cite>.
In 1900-1913 H. V. Sutherland wrote his
<cite>Sappho and Phaon</cite>, and in 1907 was published
Percy Mackaye’s tragedy with the same
title. Even when he was a student at Harvard,
he wrote an entirely distinct lyric drama in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
verse, entitled <cite>Sappho, or Archilochus and Hipponax</cite>,
in which he himself acted with a gathering
of Harvard and Wellesley students in
January, 1896. Unfortunately this drama has
not been published. The published play is
written mostly in iambic pentameter blank
verse, with a few lyrics and some trochaic and
dactylic lines; there are also several excellent
Sapphics. It has never been very successful on
the stage, although the music given with it is
still so popular that it has been recently published
by Professor Stanley (<a href="#BIBLIOGRAPHY">cf. bibliography</a>).
In the prologue a manuscript of Sappho’s
poems is imagined to have been found in excavating
the theatre of Varius at Herculaneum,
just as Lucy Milburn, who lived in Lesbos for
a while, pretended that she procured her poems
from papyri which she had discovered in a
metal case in the Orient. The scene of the
tragedy is an olive grove on a promontory overlooking
the Aegean Sea. In the first act we
have Atthis betrothed to Larichus, and Anactoria
deserted by Alcaeus for Sappho. Pittacus
is one of Sappho’s suitors who quarrels with
Alcaeus and in trying to strike him hits the
slave Phaon. In the second act Sappho releases
Phaon from his yoke and they flee from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Alcaeus after Phaon has struck him with his
spear. In the third act Phaon again strikes at
Alcaeus, but this time hits his own boy. Thalassa,
his wife, shows him his own dead child
and so he returns to her, and the rejected Sappho
springs into the misty sea. There are inappropriate
prose interludes with a pantomime of the
drunken Hercules. Sappho is here again not the
real Sappho but the Sappho of tradition, which
is rather strange, as several of Sappho’s fragments,
by no means all that might have been
suitable, are accurately and charmingly paraphrased.
This shows that Mackaye knew the
fragments of Sappho, but he has no real understanding
of Sappho herself, for his Sappho is
given to unrestrained love and she rejects a
great poet and statesman for the married slave
into whom Mackaye has transformed Phaon.
I can quote only the very dramatic hymn to
Poseidon and Aphrodite:</p>

<p>Many individual American poems have also
taken the title or themes from Sappho. Oliver
Wendell Holmes refers to her in the fourth
stanza of <cite>The Voiceless</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">In recent years many poems have appeared on
Sappho. For example, thinking perhaps of the
story that Solon asked his nephew to teach him
a song of Sappho before he died, and echoing
the epithet of “sweetly smiling” in Alcaeus’
fragment, Richard Hovey (1864-1900) wrote in
<cite>The Independent</cite>, April 30, 1896, <cite>A Dream of
Sappho</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I dreamed of Sappho on a summer night,</div>
<div class="verse">Her nightingales were singing in the trees</div>
<div class="verse">Beside the castled river; and the wind</div>
<div class="verse">Fell like a woman’s fingers on my cheek,</div>
<div class="verse">And then I slept and dreamed and marked no change;</div>
<div class="verse">The night went on with me into my dream,</div>
<div class="verse">This only I remember, that I said:</div>
<div class="verse">‘O Sappho! ere I leave this paradise,</div>
<div class="verse">Sing me one song of those lost books of yours</div>

<p>Renée Vivien (1877-1909), an American
poetess of great promise who died all too young
and all too unknown to students of Sappho
(<a href="#BIBLIOGRAPHY">see bibliography</a>), made some very nice French
verse translations of Sappho which were published
under a pseudonym in 1903 and reprinted
anonymously in 1909. She pays her tribute to
Sappho in these two verses:</p>

<p class="noindent">We have already referred to Alan Seeger’s use
of the famous midnight fragment (<a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>). The
magazines are fond of the subject of Sappho and
Phaon and have countless poems which refer
to Phaon and the Leucadian Leap. Buchanan
has a poem called <cite>The Leucadian Rock</cite>; and
Edward J. O’Brien in the <cite>Liberator</cite> says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Stir not the grasses here,</div>
<div class="verse">O wandering zephyr,</div>

Sappho, has a poem on <cite>Phaon and the Leucadian
Leap</cite> in <cite>Scribner’s Magazine</cite>, for December, 1913,

and I can give only a few lines:</p>

<p>Even as this book goes to press, Tristram
Tupper issues his novel, <cite>Adventuring</cite> (Doran Co.,
N. Y., 1923), in which Sappho is discovered
even down in the valley of the Shenandoah:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On such a night Jay Singleton discovered the
most beloved singer of all the ages. Not in the
Lesbian starlit dusk, nor yet in the golden-sandaled
dawn, but beneath a smoky lamp in the valley of
the Shenandoah. Found her in a book. And he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
liked the cut of her verses—three pentameters
followed by a dipody; and he liked the cut of her
clothes—sort of loose and careless before the
Christian era. ‘No use falling in love,’ said Jay
Singleton to himself. ‘She sang her songs six
hundred years <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>’</p>

<p>“But he pored over another fragment, translated
another quatrain, looked up each word, strung
them together, made a kind of rime. In a word,
Jay Singleton tried to improve a bit on the inimitable
Sappho. And that night out on his porch
where no one could hear, not even at the post
office quarter of a mile away, he struck the strings
of his guitar and he sang this surprising Sapphic:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Man is peer of gods in those moments after</div>
<div class="verse">Love has silenced song and has banished laughter;</div>
<div class="verse">Then—to her who smiles at him softly through tears—</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He has no peers.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“He laid aside his guitar and lit his pipe, that
made a pink glow in the darkness. He tried to
form in his mind an image of Sappho and of her
Isle of Lesbos, tried to wander back through the
labyrinthine ages, ages misty with music, dusky
with gold, red with wars, and blushing with roses—forgotten
wars, faded roses mingling to form the
perfume of the centuries. He pulled on his pipe.
‘Where is she now?’ Easy enough to imagine
Sappho with her ivory throat, her violet eyes and
sandals of golden dawn, back in the golden dawn
of poetry. For, overhead, these were her stars.
But he wondered about the form her singing soul
had taken after she had leaped into the Ionian Sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Had the waters quenched the spark, or was her
soul immortal—a flame that twenty-five hundred
years had failed to extinguish? Again he asked:
‘Where are you now? Where in this, the most
cluttered up of all the ages?’ He tried to imagine
her beside the Little Calfpasture—Sappho beside
the Calfpasture Creek, sighing, laughing, singing
her lyrics! ‘No use falling in love! Sang your songs
twenty-five hundred years ago!’”</p>

<p>In May, 1922, Miss Bertha Bennett of Carleton
College produced an interesting pageant “A Grecian
Festival” on the Sappho and Phaon story, with adaptations
of Sappho’s first two odes and representing
Sappho as leaping into Lyman lake. It ends with
the union of Sappho and Phaon, after death, on Mt.
Olympus.</p>

<p>Many Russian writers mention Sappho, especially Vyacheslav
Ivanov; and in a volume republished in Berlin, 1923,
(<cite>Zovy Drevnosti</cite>, <cite>Echoes of the Past</cite>) Konstantin Dmitriyevich
Balmont has translated eight of Sappho’s fragments. The
same poet (<cite>Zacharovanny Grot</cite>, <cite>The Enchanted Grotto</cite>, vol. III,
1908) has published a poem on Sappho which my former
student, now of Columbia University, Dr. Clarence Manning,
has translated in the original metre:</p>

<h2 id="XII_SAPPHOS_INFLUENCE_ON_MUSIC">XII. SAPPHO’S INFLUENCE ON MUSIC</h2>

<p>On the operatic stage Sappho has had
much influence; and above I have
told how Lamartine said that Sappho
was a superb subject for an opera, although he
never wrote the opera, and how Grillparzer was
asked to write an opera on Sappho. In French
we have a lyrical tragedy, <cite>Sapho</cite>, by Empis
and Courniol (1818), Delavault’s <cite>Sapho</cite> and
Gounod’s <cite>Sapho</cite> (1851); and a few years ago
(1897) Massenet produced his <cite>Sapho</cite>. In Italian
there is Pacini’s <cite>Saffo</cite> (Naples 1840); in Dutch,
Bree’s <cite>Sapho</cite>; in German, Schwartzendorf’s
<cite>Sappho</cite> and Kanne’s <cite>Sappho</cite>; in Bohemian,
there is Reicha’s <cite>Sappho</cite>; and in Russian,
Lissenko’s <cite>Sappho</cite>.</p>

<p>Brahms composed a <cite>Sapphic Ode</cite>, which is
very familiar because it is often sung to-day and
there is an English victrola record of it by
Julia Clausen, but while it deals with Sappho’s
favorite flower, the rose, it is Sapphic only in
name and metre:</p>

<p class="noindent">From the time of the <cite>Schemata Musica</cite> printed
in Volger’s edition of 1810, down to the music
published by G. Cipollini in 1890 in his brother’s
<cite>Saffo</cite>, many have put Sappho’s songs to music.
Even in the last few years many have tried their
hand at the task. Perhaps the most successful
music, with a real touch of the old Greek flavor,
is that which was composed by Professor Stanley
for several of Sappho’s fragments in connection
with Mr. Harrison Grey Fiske’s stage presentation
of Percy Mackaye’s <cite>Sappho and Phaon</cite>.
This has been reprinted this year in a general
treatment of Greek music by Professor Stanley
of the University of Michigan. The selections
published include “Builders, Build the
Roof-Beam High, Hymenaeon”; “Gath’rers,
What Have We Forgot, Hymenaeon!”; “What
shall we do, Cytherea?”; “Hollow Shell, Horny
Shell”; “Akoue, Poseidon”; “Hesper, Eleleu”,
etc. Miss Pearl C. Wilson, of Miss Chandor’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
School in New York, a former student of Professor
Perry of Columbia University, without
making any pretense of reproducing the ancient
music has composed musical accompaniments
for several of the odes and also of the new fragments,
which have been sung with much success.
She tried to illustrate the metre of each
fragment, but found it more satisfactory to
write the music without the modern division
into bars and rests, simply indicating the long
and short syllables by notes of different values.
This makes possible a lyric delivery of the poems,
each line determined solely by the words and
their meaning. In that way the simple melodies
as expressions of the thought gain a great
deal when sung. I can testify from my own
public experiments in readings from Sappho that
her fragments can be much better recited or
chanted when accompanied by music, as I am
convinced they were originally.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XIII_EPILOGUE_AND_CONCLUSION">XIII. EPILOGUE AND CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>I venture to hope that out of all I have
written in the preceding pages some fairly
clear idea of Sappho may have emerged.
Yet the discussion has had to wander widely
through literature which has, indeed, been influenced
strongly by her name but journeys far
from the Lesbian lyrist herself. In closing this
study it may be well, therefore, to return to
the woman and the poet and add some final
words.</p>

<p>The fragments of many other ancient poets
have been collected for merely scholastic reasons,
but Sappho’s literary remains are more
than antique specimens. They constitute a
great and noble literature and some of the latest
found are among the best. They often rank as
highly as the completed poems of other writers—surely
an unparalleled phenomenon. In them
we recognize the creator’s genius as clearly as
in a fragmentary torso of Phidias we see the
sculptor’s art in every chiselled line. While we
miss the fullness of her life, we can restore her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
figure because the fragments are “the real blood
of her heart and the real flame of her thought.”
Nearly every line of them has been imitated,
dilated or diluted, and, disgraceful to say, many
who have drunk of her living water have
poisoned it into stagnant and salacious slime.
There is nothing like this in the history of literature.
Higginson in 1871 summarized the case:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What other woman played such a part in
moulding the great literature that has moulded the
world? Colonel Mure thinks that a hundred such
women might have demoralized all Greece. But
it grew demoralized at any rate; and even the
island where Sappho taught took its share in the
degradation. If, on the other hand, the view taken
of her by more careful criticism be correct, a hundred
such women might have done much to save
it. Modern nations must again take up the problem
where Athens failed and Lesbos only pointed
the way to the solution,—to create a civilization
where the highest culture shall be extended to
woman also. It is not enough that we should dream,
with Plato, of a republic where man is free and
woman but a serf. The aspirations of modern life
culminate, like the greatest of modern poems, in
the elevation of womanhood. ‘Die ewige Weibliche
zieht uns hinan.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Sappho, then, was a pure and good woman,
busily and successfully engaged in the work of
her chosen profession. She was a teacher of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
singing and dancing and the technique of poetry,
and to give her pupils the finest models she
applied herself so seriously to the lyric art that
she reached a perfection in it to which no other
classic poet attained. If she ever collected her
verse it was only to promote the idealization
of marriage pageants, and not with the purpose
of publishing a full edition of her songs. It
would not be safe to deny that there was a
practically useful collection of Sappho’s songs
in the archives of her school or guild or in the
Temple of Aphrodite, but no copies were sold
at the book-stalls in her own day as certainly
was later the case in fifth century Athens.</p>

<p>Sappho, in fact, must be listed with two other
names which, taken together, form a unique
and astonishing group, a group whose peculiar
and distinguishing feature is that their enduring
thoughts and imperishable words were indispensable
necessities in their life-work rather
than productions as literature for the sake of
literature. It is not because of the accidental
alliteration that we rank Sappho with Socrates
and Shakespeare. These great exemplars of
song, ethics, and drama, respectively, were alike
in that it was not by their intention that their
works became literature. Shakespeare as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
theatrical manager was obliged by his position
to write plays that would attract audiences.
He was compelled by his genius to make those
dramas imperishable. But if he had had his
way none of them would ever have been printed.
Our gratitude must be given to prompters’
copies and to literary thieves. Socrates was a
teacher whose purely oral lessons his pupils,
Plato and Xenophon, committed to writing
that the master’s inspiring thoughts might
not die.</p>

<p>Socrates’ love for his young disciples was a
love passing the love of women. The myriad-minded
man of Stratford,—“Gentle Will,” as
his comrades called him,—had an affectionate
sympathy with all sorts and conditions of his
fellow-men. Sappho’s love for her girl friends
was so intense that there are those who, not
knowing how passionate the love of woman can
be for woman, still fail, despite the evidence, to
recognize a love more sublime even than that
for man.</p>

<p>How jealous she could be of her family’s good
name! More than once she prays that no dishonor
may come to her house. How jealous
also of those who sought to win away the love
of her girls and of the girls themselves when any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of them seemed to have forgotten her! How intensely,
too, she could hate, the outbursting
passion against the “she-dog” at the close of
fragment E 36, which we have translated on
<a href="#Page_20">page 20</a>, may serve to suggest. The fierceness
of her satire is also incidentally shown in this
as well as in other fragments. (See E 35, 37, 71,
<i>et al.</i>)</p>

<p>Like Socrates and Shakespeare Sappho had a
planetary mind swinging in its orbit with ease
through all realms, whether of nature, or human
nature, or the divine nature of the unseen world.
This need not be elaborated here, save in
Sappho’s case. But it may be worth while to
repeat some of the evidence as to Sappho’s wide
range of thought as it is seen in a few typical
instances. She loved the roses, the clover, and
the anthrysc. She loved the doves and the
nightingales, and knew their colorings and discerned
their ways. But the unplucked apple
on the top of the topmost bough, the myriad
ears of the listening night that hears what the
girl across the sea says and relays it right over
the waves, the rosy-fingered moon well above
the horizon and launching light across the rolling
sea and over the fields of flowers, reveal
even in the fragments which are “small but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
roses” how surpassing were her instincts for
nature’s loftier meanings as well as its minute
details and how exquisite were her comparisons.
As for the phases of love—they were her daily
business,—and each new couple whose wedding
festivities she arranged in song gave her new
material. Where in all literature is there a
finer example of the union of human love along
with insight into the soul of nature than in the
ode, <cite>To Absent Anactoria</cite>? (<a href="#Page_72">See p. 72</a>).</p>

<p>As we have said, she knew the heart of the
Greek bride and her dread at the loss of her free
virginity. Mother love, too, was never more
exquisitely portrayed than in the song we
have quoted on <a href="#Page_27">pp. 27-28</a>. But the subject of
woman’s love for woman is peculiarly her
own. The finest lines in all Sappho’s poetry
are those descriptive of Anactoria in a poem
which we might call <cite>Old Love is Best</cite> (E. 38,
<a href="#Page_82">pp. 82-83 above</a>).</p>

<p>Finished style, the γλαφυρὸς χαρακτήρ, as
the Greek critics called it, simple purity but
effective luminosity and exquisite rarity of expression,
faultless constraint, fine taste in choosing
appropriate subjects, marvellous verbal
economy, comprehensive power in single words,
fiery passion as well as austerity, richness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
beauty, good arrangement of words, assonance,
alliteration, consonantal harmonies, lingering
vowel music and melody, produced often by the
repetition of long vowels, the soft Aeolic quality
of the Greek sounds, swift changes of nature
and enchanting images, varied metres, but
above all else, charm, that greatest characteristic
of Sappho so emphasized by the ancients
and moderns,—all these qualities she used
that her songs and hymns might be perfect.
It is this simple natural perfection of her art,
like the “nothing too much” of the Parthenon
frieze, that makes her untranslatable, even
though it is precisely the quality which modern
literature lacks but needs. Her nature was so
great and her genius so marvellous and her
purposes so inexorable that, in attending with
her whole soul to her business as the poetic
and musical caterer for successive weddings
upon an ancient and interesting island, she
incidentally made word-music and created
thought-images which sounded the depths and
scaled the heights of human passion and which
winged their way to distant shores. The strains
of her songs are beginning to be heard everywhere
and are ever growing clearer and sweeter
in this present timely century, the century of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
woman’s exaltation and glorification. Her
genius is concisely summed up by Watts-Dunton
in his <cite>Essay on Poetry</cite>, as follows: “<em>Never before
these songs were sung, and never since, did the
human soul, in the grip of a fiery passion, utter
a cry like hers; and, from the executive point of
view, in directness, in lucidity, in that high, imperious
verbal economy which only nature can
teach the artist, she has no equal, and none worthy
to take the place of second.</em>”</p>

<p>In the Lesbus and the Asia Minor of Sappho’s
day as in those of Homer, women were at their
zenith and were allowed greater freedom in life
and speech than in later Athens where woman’s
position had reached its nadir, even though
literature and art had attained their highest
bloom. In Athens women were cabin’d, cribb’d,
confined. The more ancient Greeks in general,
however, even if their law made the wife the
property of her lord and master, appreciated
their women and considered them close to the
divine, else they would not have appointed them
to important priesthoods and other offices and
to be interpreters of the desires of the gods and
counsellors of their own political troubles.
Sappho was a twentieth century woman living
in sixth century Lesbus, who could go about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
town without a chaperon and take part in the
most intellectual and religious meetings. Of
course she was “ni une sainte ni surtout une
prude,” as Reinach says. Rarely is a woman
who is interesting a “saint.” Reinach compares
her also to Madame de Sévigné, who wrote
to her daughter “paroles de feu et de fièvre ...
tout pareils à ceux de l’amour.” What with
her teaching, with her own writings, and with
the executive work of the <i>hetairiai</i>, those
ancient Y. W. C. A.’s for the cultivation of
poetry and music, which Mackail has so aptly
compared with the Courts of Love which
existed in Languedoc from the twelfth to the
fourteenth century, she was too noble and too
busy to be devoted to ignobler ways, falsely
ascribed to her. But her love was deeper than
that of the schoolgirl in convent, conservatory
of music, or literary club. She was no Ruskin-like
school-mistress presiding over a group of
virtuous but bold young women. She was
respectable and respected. There was in her
sacred guild under the patronage of Aphrodite
“l’étroite et tendre intimité de jeunes
filles de bonne naissance entre elles et avec
leurs dirigeantes” (Reinach). But we utterly
reject to-day the Athenian vaudeville idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Sappho, who never should have been branded
a courtesan.</p>

<p>How the fine radiance Sappho shed on
woman’s love for woman and on her love of
love and on the glory of pure and honorable
marriage shines at last across these twenty-five
hundred years! Her figure stands there on her
isle. In itself it is white marble veined with
gold. Much mud from many lands has been
flung against it. For centuries, almost for
millenniums, it has been soiled and stained.
Even good men have come to think of the
stains as integral parts of the statue, and of
the gold as base metal. But the winds and
rains of time have tired out the soilers and
washed the figure white and clean of all Attic
and all later defilings. It is all pure marble now,
veined with warm gold. Something that suggests
the Pygmalion miracle is happening to it.
The statue is alive and luminous with its own
beauty, grace, and power. Sappho’s poetry
deals with the eternal experiences of the human
heart and carries with it those touches which
make the whole world kin. As T. G. Tucker
says: “Love and Sorrow are re-born with every
human being. Time and civilisation make little
difference.”</p>

<cite>Das Marmor Parium</cite>, 1904, p. 101. Many sources call Sappho

<cite>Phaedrus</cite>, 235 c; Arist., <cite>Rhet.</cite>, 1398 b; <cite>Anth. Pal.</cite>, VII. 17. Some
scholars assume that there were two Sapphos, but the two
traditions can easily be reconciled by supposing that Sappho
belonged to both cities, born at Eresus but later living at
Mytilene. Edmonds thinks that Strabo would have mentioned
Sappho when he is speaking of Eresus (618), had he
believed her to have been born there, but Strabo omits many
famous writers. The tradition of two Sapphos is found also
in Aelian, <cite>Historical Miscellanies</cite>, XII. 19 and in Suidas.
Cf. the novel <cite>Beulah</cite> by Augusta Evans, pp. 216-218: “Do
you think that Sappho’s frenzy was established by the
Leucadian leap? You confound the poetess with a Sappho,
who lived later, and threw herself into the sea from the
promontory of Leucate. Doubtless she too had ‘poetic idiosyncrasies,’
but her spotless life, and I believe natural death,
afford no indication of an unsound intellect.”</p>

a widow.” But we have no such evidence, how old Cleïs

or Brochea, corresponding to Catullus’ Lesbia, should be read
and now translates: “When I look on you, Brocheo, my
speech comes short or fails me quite.” Formerly he thought
that the poem was sent by the banished Sappho at the age
of eighteen to some beloved girl friend soon after her arrival
in Sicily in 596 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, but Sappho was older than eighteen in
596, and Edmonds now makes an entirely different emendation
of the last line, “but now that I am poor, I must fain
be content ...” meaning “beggars can’t be choosers.”
But the reading is uncertain and I do not believe that Sappho
was poor, nor do I agree with Miss Patrick that the words
do not describe love at all.</p>

<p><a name="Note_94" id="Note_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94">94.</a> German and Austrian scholars have failed to see the
lovely lyrical literature in this delightful ballad. Aly considers
it only the beginning of a longer ode; and I cannot
agree with him that it does not fit in with what we know of
Sappho who often expresses her loneliness in the absence of
her companions. Even if the thought is of love, we must not
expect consistency in a high-strung Aeolian woman. Fragments
such as E. 152, 159, 167 may have been in a totally
different context. But I do not mean to say that the ballad
certainly refers to Sappho herself. The context is gone and
it is not even definitely assigned to Sappho. Some of the
editions seem to have contained it, but much anonymous
literature has been included in the Sapphic <i>corpus</i> as in that
of Plato or Hippocrates. However, as it is one of the prettiest
and most perfect pieces and quite in Sappho’s style and metre
and thought, I consider it genuine. Ovid (<cite>Sappho to Phaon</cite>,
155 ff.) seems to know the lines. Ruthlessly to insert a
negative in the text (“Alone I do not sleep”) as does Lunák
(<cite>Wiener Studien</cite>, XL, 1918, p. 98) spoils the literary quality
and makes it insipid. How much suggestive concision in
those seventeen words in four verses (four of them small
particles), but what vast and profound humanity; silence,
solitude, obscurity, waiting, anxiety, sympathy of nature.
How the strong and rapid description catches our deepest
thoughts. Such things disprove the arguments against its
genuineness by Wilamowitz, <cite>Textgeschichte</cite>, p. 33; and <cite>Sappho
und Simonides</cite>, p. 75. Cf. Münscher, <cite>Hermes</cite>, LIV. 29, 4

ἀσέλγεια τριβακή, “Schon in früher Zeit galten Sparta und
die Insel Lesbos als Orte, wo die weibliche Liebe besonders
verbreitet war und an letzterem Ort in der Dichterin
Sappho eine weltberühmte Vertreterin fand.” Cf.

that Sappho was “eine echte Tribade.” It is lamentable
that as great a literary critic as J. A. Symonds should say
that “Sappho gave this female passion an eminent place in
Greek Literature;” see J. A. Symonds, <cite>A Problem in Greek

copy, which is a second edition (Lyon 1696), it is stated that
permission to publish the book was granted to Damoiselle
Anne Le Fèvre on June 10, 1681, all rights to continue for
six years. “Le dit livre a esté achevé d’imprimer pour la
première fois le 1, Decembre 1681.” My copy gives only
the first two odes and the epigrams on Pelagon and Timas
and quotes an inaccurate Latin prose translation of the first
ode by her father. He has made several emendations, as in
ode II, l. 7, ὡς βρόγχον, “nihil vocis pervenit ad fauces meas,”
as good a suggestion as Edmonds’ creation of an unknown
proper name Brocheo.</p>

<p><a name="Note_172" id="Note_172"></a><a href="#FNanchor_172">172.</a> My copy is the thirteenth edition published by
Bertrand, Paris, 1818. The idea of a manuscript of Sappho
found at Herculaneum is repeated by Lucy Milburn and
Percy Mackaye.</p>

<p><a name="Note_173" id="Note_173"></a><a href="#FNanchor_173">173.</a> My copy is dated London 1810 and is anonymous,
<cite>Poésies de Sapho suivies de différentes Poésies dans le même
genre</cite>. It contains also <cite>Les Tourterelles de Zelmis</cite> and the
<cite>Poésies Erotiques</cite> of M. de Parny, who was such an admirer
of Sappho. The adaptations are the same as those of Sauvigny.
Why this edition is anonymous, I do not know.</p>

<p><a name="Note_175" id="Note_175"></a><a href="#FNanchor_175">175.</a> My edition is Giguet et Michaud, Paris, 1805. This
book with its long notes and citations, though little known,
is important for the student of Sappho’s influence.</p>

<p><a name="Note_176" id="Note_176"></a><a href="#FNanchor_176">176.</a> Cf. Wilamowitz, <cite>Sappho und Simonides</cite>, pp. 63-69
on <cite>Chansons de Bilitis</cite>, pp. 71-78 on Lesbian Love.</p>

<p><a name="Note_177" id="Note_177"></a><a href="#FNanchor_177">177.</a> Cf. Edwin M. Cox, p. 5, where he quotes Barnabe
Barnes’ <cite>Parthenophil and Parthenophe</cite>, 1593:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">O, that I could make her, whom I love best,</div>
<div class="verse">Find in a face, with misery wrinkled,</div>
<div class="verse">Find in a heart, with sighs over ill-pined,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Her cruel hatred.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In Davison’s <cite>Poetical Rhapsody</cite>, 1602, are some Sapphics by
the mysterious “A. W.” Here is a sample:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Hatred eternal, furious revenging,</div>
<div class="verse">Merciless raging, bloody persecuting;</div>
<div class="verse">Slanderous speeches, odious revilings;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Causeless abhorring.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In 1601 Campion and Roseter, <cite>Lyrics, Elegies</cite>, etc., give a
clumsy example of Sapphic verse. In 1614 a tract called
<cite>The Martyrdom of Saint George of Cappadocia</cite> contains at the
end some “Sapphicks” which resemble the real Sappho only
in having the same number of syllables to the verse. Cox and
all others, so far as I know, fail to mention Sir Philip Sidney’s
translation of the second ode.</p>
